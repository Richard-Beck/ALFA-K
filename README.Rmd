ALFA-K takes longitudinal single cell sequencing data from an evolving cell population as input, then estimates a local fitness landscape encompassing thousands of karyotypes located near to the input data in karyotype space. This repository contains source code and examples for running ALFA-K, as well as an Agent Based Model (ABM) which simulates evolving cell populations using fitness landscapes estimated by ALFA-K.

The repository is organized as follows:

```{r,echo=F,include=F}

path <- c(
    "ALFA-K/ABM/agent based model source code", 
    "ALFA-K/examples/example_0/visualizing karyotype frequencies and ALFA-K fits", 
    "ALFA-K/examples/example_1/basics of running ABM and fitting landscapes", 
    "ALFA-K/examples/example_2/cross validation procedure for ALFA-K landscapes", 
    "ALFA-K/example_data/example datasets", 
    "ALFA-K/utils/ALFA-K source code and utility functions"
)


library(data.tree); library(plyr)

x <- lapply(strsplit(path, "/"), function(z) as.data.frame(t(z)))
x <- rbind.fill(x)
x$pathString <- apply(x, 1, function(x) paste(trimws(na.omit(x)), collapse="/"))
(mytree <- data.tree::as.Node(x))

```

```{r,include=F}
mytree

```

The ABM requires compilation before use. E.g. to compile with the GCC C++ compiler, change to ALFA-K root directory and run:

```{r,eval=F}
g++ ./ABM/main.cpp -o ./ABM/bin/ABM -std=c++17
```
