  abstract = "IMPORTANCE: The programmed death 1 (PD-1) pathway limits immune
              responses to melanoma and can be blocked with the humanized
              anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab. OBJECTIVE: To
              characterize the association of pembrolizumab with tumor response
              and overall survival among patients with advanced melanoma.
              DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: Open-label, multicohort,
              phase 1b clinical trials (enrollment, December 2011-September
              2013). Median duration of follow-up was 21 months. The study was
              performed in academic medical centers in Australia, Canada,
              France, and the United States. Eligible patients were aged 18
              years and older and had advanced or metastatic melanoma. Data
              were pooled from 655 enrolled patients (135 from a nonrandomized
              cohort [n = 87 ipilimumab naive; n = 48 ipilimumab treated] and
              520 from randomized cohorts [n = 226 ipilimumab naive; n = 294
              ipilimumab treated]). Cutoff dates were April 18, 2014, for
              safety analyses and October 18, 2014, for efficacy analyses.
              EXPOSURES: Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 3
              weeks, or 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks continued until disease
              progression, intolerable toxicity, or investigator decision. MAIN
              OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was confirmed
              objective response rate (best overall response of complete
              response or partial response) in patients with measurable disease
              at baseline per independent central review. Secondary end points
              included toxicity, duration of response, progression-free
              survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: Among the 655 patients
              (median [range] age, 61 [18-94] years; 405 [62\%] men), 581 had
              measurable disease at baseline. An objective response was
              reported in 194 of 581 patients (33\% [95\% CI, 30\%-37\%]) and
              in 60 of 133 treatment-naive patients (45\% [95\% CI, 36\% to
              54\%]). Overall, 74\% (152/205) of responses were ongoing at the
              time of data cutoff; 44\% (90/205) of patients had response
              duration for at least 1 year and 79\% (162/205) had response
              duration for at least 6 months. Twelve-month progression-free
              survival rates were 35\% (95\% CI, 31\%-39\%) in the total
              population and 52\% (95\% CI, 43\%-60\%) among treatment-naive
              patients. Median overall survival in the total population was 23
              months (95\% CI, 20-29) with a 12-month survival rate of 66\%
              (95\% CI, 62\%-69\%) and a 24-month survival rate of 49\% (95\%
              CI, 44\%-53\%). In treatment-naive patients, median overall
              survival was 31 months (95\% CI, 24 to not reached) with a
              12-month survival rate of 73\% (95\% CI, 65\%-79\%) and a
              24-month survival rate of 60\% (95\% CI, 51\%-68\%). Ninety-two
              of 655 patients (14\%) experienced at least 1 treatment-related
              grade 3 or 4 adverse event (AE) and 27 of 655 (4\%) patients
              discontinued treatment because of a treatment-related AE.
              Treatment-related serious AEs were reported in 59 patients (9\%).
              There were no drug-related deaths. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
              Among patients with advanced melanoma, pembrolizumab
              administration was associated with an overall objective response
              rate of 33\%, 12-month progression-free survival rate of 35\%,
              and median overall survival of 23 months; grade 3 or 4
              treatment-related AEs occurred in 14\%. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Fragmentation of genomic DNA in apoptosis/programmed
              cell death (PCD) is a characteristic hallmark in which both 2N
              and 4N DNA from G1, S, and G2/M cell cycle phases were seen
              degraded to the sub-2N Ao level in PCD such as from serum
              deprivation, glucocorticoid treatment, and gamma-radiation.
              However M-phase (mitotic) cells are said to perish only via
              non-programmed or necrotic cell death unless they were allowed to
              complete cytokinesis and re-enter interphase. The morphological
              criteria of PCD refer only to interphase cells with intact
              nuclear membranes, none seems applied to mitotic cells. We show
              here autophagic sequestration of mitotic chromosomes in a typical
              PCD response where G1, S, and G2/M DNA were replaced by a sub-2N
              Ao peak, suggesting that mitotic cells may yet have the option of
              PCD or suicide. Autophagy is absent in necrosis. METHODS: Mitotic
              human Chang liver cells in normal monolayer culture were compared
              with apoptotic counterparts initiated by a burst of hydroxyl free
              radicals (OH*) generated from vanadium internalized by an NH4Cl
              prepulse containing vanadyl(4) ions. Total (free and bound)
              vanadium uptake was quantitated by elemental spectral analysis of
              single cells using a) Particle-Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE)
              profiling, and b) Scanning Transmission Ion Microscopy (STIM) in
              the nuclear microscope. The Coulter EPICS PROFILE II flow
              cytometer was used for a) the cell cycle analysis using propidium
              iodide-DNA binding, b) intracellular pH (pHi) evaluation in the
              acidification-and-recovery cycle, using ratiometric
              2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)
              fluorescence quantitation. Transmission electron microscopy
              examined the morphological changes. Vanadyl(4)- generated
              hydroxyl free radicals (OH*) were evaluated by measuring
              OH*-benzoic adduct fluorescence at 304/413 nm using the SPEX
              Fluoromax photon counting spectrofluorometer. RESULTS: Nuclear
              microscopy showed that a 30 min acidification prepulse containing
              4mM vanadyl(4) ions, V(4), had increased the total (free and
              bound) vanadium concentration of human Chang liver cells from
              normal ultratrace levels to 56,992 ppm of dry wt (1.1174 Eq per
              kg dry wt). After the prepulse, cells realkalinized in DMEM
              growth medium, recovering to the physiological pHi level in 30
              min. At the physiological pH 7 level, V(4) generated a burst of
              OH* free radicals in the order of 15,000 folds above the prepulse
              (pH 4.5) level. In these conditions, spectrofluorometric
              evaluation showed loss of DNA intercalation with propidium iodide
              (PI-DNA binding) indicating DNA degradation. Cell-by-cell
              evaluation of the PI-DNA binding by flow cytometry showed
              abolition of G1, S, and G2/M phases and their replacement by a
              sub-2N Ao peak of fragmented DNA, emulating serum deprivation PCD
              in these cells. Immediately upon initiating an OH* burst
              ultrastructural profiles showed mitotic chromosomes (M-phase
              chromatin) being surrounded by rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
              and small vesicles, indicating their sequestration in
              autophagosomes. Autophagy was also seen to be a prominent feature
              in serum deprivation PCD. CONCLUSION: Sequestration of mitotic
              chromosomes by autophagosomes in a typical PCD response showed a
              well-defined morphological pathway for direct degradation of
              M-phase chromatin without first completing cytokinesis. Mitotic
              cells could commit suicide via autophagy directed at its own
              chromatin. Autophagic sequestration of chromatin in PCD is novel.",

              provide historical survival expectations. A total of 826 patients

              has been associated with enhanced resistance to stress, whereas
              on the organismal level it is detrimental to multicellular
              species. Certain aneuploid karyotypes are deleterious for

              stimulation of the CTL. Although granzyme A is stored in the
              lytic granules over this period, the majority of granzyme A

              degranulation also results in new synthesis of the lytic
              proteins, which can be inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX). Some of

              also higher in dihydrocytochalasin B (DCB)-induced polyploid
              cells, suggesting that higher levels of ROS observed in polyploid

  abstract = "SUMMARYThis paper presents an advanced failure surface
              propagation concept based on the marching cubes algorithm
              initially proposed in the field of computer graphics and applies
              it to the embedded finite element method. When modeling
              three-dimensional (3D) solids at failure, the propagation of the
              failure surface representing a crack or shear band should not
              exhibit a strong sensitivity to the details of the finite element
              discretization. This results in the need for a propagation of the
              discrete failure zone through the individual finite elements,
              which is possible for finite elements with embedded strong
              discontinuities. Whereas for two-dimensional calculations the
              failure zone propagation location is easily predicted by the
              maximal principal stress direction, more advanced strategies are
              needed to achieve a smooth failure surface in 3D simulations. An
              example for such method is the global tracking algorithm, which
              predicts the crack path by a scalar level set function computed
              on the basis of the solution of a simplified heat conduction like
              problem. Its prediction may though lead to various scenarios on
              how the failure surface may propagate through the individual
              finite elements. In particular, for a hexahedral eight-node
              finite element, 256 such cases exist. To capture all those
              possibilities, the marching cubes algorithm is combined with the
              global tracking algorithm and the finite elements with embedded
              strong discontinuities in this work. In addition, because many of
              the possible cases result in non-planar failure surfaces within a
              single finite element and because the local quantities used to
              describe the kinematics of the embedded strong discontinuities
              are physically meaningful in a strict sense only for planar
              failure surfaces, a remedy for such scenarios is proposed.
              Various 3D failure propagation simulations outline the
              performance of the proposed concept. Copyright ? 2013 John Wiley

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: A profound difference between cancer and normal
              tissues is the preferential utilization of glycolysis by cancer
              cells. To translate this paradigm in the clinic, we completed a
              phase I study of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG), and assessed 2DG uptake
              with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)
              and the autophagy substrate p62 as a marker of 2DG resistance.
              METHODS: Patients received 2DG orally on days 1-14 of a 21-day
              cycle in cohorts of three in a dose-escalating manner.
              Correlative assessments included PET scans at baseline and day 2
              and p62 protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a
              potential marker of 2DG resistance. RESULTS: The dose of 45 mg/kg
              was defined as the recommended phase II dose, secondary to
              dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 asymptomatic QTc prolongation
              at a dose of 60 mg/kg. PK evaluation of 2DG revealed linear
              pharmacokinetics with C(max) 45 microg/ml (277 microM), 73.7
              microg/ml (449 microM), and 122 microg/ml (744 microM) in dose
              levels 30, 45, and 60 mg/kg, respectively. Five of eight patients
              assessed with FDG-PET scanning demonstrated decreased FDG uptake
              by day 2 of therapy, suggesting competition of 2DG with FDG. Five
              of six patients assessed for p62 had a decrease in p62 at 24 hr.
              CONCLUSIONS: These data support the safety of 2DG, defined 2DG
              PK, demonstrated the effect of 2DG on FDG-PET imaging, and
              demonstrated the feasibility of assessment of p62 as an

              IFN-alpha-induced apoptosis using Daudi B lymphoma cells.
              IFN-alpha upregulated the expression of TRAIL within 12 h, as
              assessed by flow cytometry and RT-PCR, and the level increased
              with time until 72 h. The levels of both TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2,
              low in Daudi cells, were enhanced by IFN-alpha. The enhanced
              TRAIL-R1/-R2 appeared to function as a death-inducing molecule

              (FasL) expression in two well-characterized murine microglia cell
              lines (BV-2 and N9). Nuclear fragmentation, suggestive of
              apoptosis, was noted within 24 h of incubation of microglia with
              IFN-gamma (10 U/ml). After a 72-h incubation, almost every BV-2

              death and detached from the culture plates. This cytotoxicity
              occurred even at low IFN-gamma concentrations (1 U/ml) and was
              inhibited by BAF, a pan-caspase inhibitor. Incubation of BV-2 and

              increased by as much as 200\% in the N9 cells. These findings

              IFN-gamma may also induce apoptosis of microglia, possibly
              through simultaneous upregulation of Fas and FasL.
              Interferon-gamma modulation of the Fas pathway and apoptosis in

               surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. This study aims at aiding in
               the design of more efficacious GBM therapies. We constructed a
               mathematical model for glioma and the immune system
               interactions, that may ensue upon direct intra-tumoral
               administration of ex vivo activated alloreactive
               cytotoxic-T-lymphocytes (aCTL). Our model encompasses
               considerations of the interactive dynamics of aCTL, tumor cells,
               major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and MHC class II
               molecules, as well as cytokines, such as TGF-beta and IFN-gamma,
               which dampen or increase the pro-inflammatory environment,
               respectively. Computer simulations were used for model
               verification and for retrieving putative treatment scenarios.
               The mathematical model successfully retrieved clinical trial
               results of efficacious aCTL immunotherapy for recurrent
               anaplastic oligodendroglioma and anaplastic astrocytoma (WHO
               grade III). It predicted that cellular adoptive immunotherapy
               failed in GBM because the administered dose was 20-fold lower
               than required for therapeutic efficacy. Model analysis suggests
               that GBM may be eradicated by new dose-intensive strategies,
               e.g., 3 x 10(8) aCTL every 4 days for small tumor burden, or 2 x
               10(9) aCTL, infused every 5 days for larger tumor burden.
               Further analysis pinpoints crucial bio-markers relating to tumor
               growth rate, tumor size, and tumor sensitivity to the immune
               system, whose estimation enables regimen personalization. We
               propose that adoptive cellular immunotherapy was prematurely
               abandoned. It may prove efficacious for GBM, if dose intensity
               is augmented, as prescribed by the mathematical model.

              of patients fail to respond. Besides T-cell dysfunction, T-cell
              apoptosis was reported in several recent studies as a relevant
              mechanism of tumoral immune resistance. Several death receptors
              (Fas, DR3, DR4, DR5, TNFR1) can trigger apoptosis when activated
              by their respective ligands. In this review, we discuss the
              immunomodulatory role of the main death receptors and how these
              are shaping the tumor microenvironment, with a focus on Fas and
              its ligand. Fas-mediated apoptosis of T cells has long been known
              as a mechanism allowing the contraction of T-cell responses to
              prevent immunopathology, a phenomenon known as activation-induced
              cell death, which is triggered by induction of Fas ligand (FasL)
              expression on T cells themselves and qualifies as an immune
              checkpoint mechanism. Recent evidence indicates that other cells
              in the tumor microenvironment can express FasL and trigger
              apoptosis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), including
              endothelial cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. The
              resulting disappearance of TIL prevents anti-tumor immunity and
              may in fact contribute to the absence of TIL that is typical of
              ``cold'' tumors that fail to respond to immunotherapy.
              Interfering with the Fas-FasL pathway in the tumor

              starting at a dose of 2 mg/kg and docetaxel was administered
              intravenously at 30 mg/m(2) for 3 of every 4 weeks beginning on
              day 1 of week 2. Following the completion of dose escalation,
              cohorts of patients were then treated with 2DG for 21 days or
              every day of each 4-week cycle for up to 12 cycles. RESULTS:
              Thirty-four patients were enrolled: 21 on every other week, 6 on
              a 21 of 28-day cycle and 7 on the continuous 2DG dosing schedule.

              clinically tolerable dose. The most significant adverse effects
              noted at 63-88 mg/kg doses were reversible hyperglycemia (100

              metastases, with a focus on tumor endothelial cells (ECs). While
              ECs in liver tissue adjacent to cancerous lesions (so-called

              to Wald's method if the asymptotic properties of the maximum

              intervals can be difficult to solve in these situations, because
              the likelihood function may exhibit unfavorable properties. As a
              result, existing methods may be inefficient and yield misleading

              profile likelihood confidence intervals via a trust-region

              constrained to regions where these approximations are

              applicable in many scenarios where earlier approaches are shown

              we apply our algorithm to benchmark problems and compare it with

               clarified. The interrelationships among contact lysis, release
               of pharmacologically active substances, and the terminal
               components of the complement system are given in the chapter for
               special consideration. In an in vitro model, it is shown that
               lymphoid cells from sensitized donors destroy tissue culture
               cells carrying the antigen to which the cell donor is
               sensitized. This type of cytolytic reactions is encountered in a
               great variety of immune situations, comprising all those
               mentioned in the chapter. The cell that initiates in vitro
               cytotoxic reaction is assumed to be the sensitized lymphocyte,
               equipped with its own recognition sites for antigen on the cells
               that are destroyed. Although this may be true in many
               situations, it now seems clear that ``normal'' lymphoid cells
               can become cytotoxic to other cells by a variety of pathways.
               The study of the various pathways by which lymphoid cells can
               become cytotoxic has been helpful for the understanding of
               effector role of these cells in cell-destructive reactions in
               general.",

               degradation into lysosomes through what is known as autophagy.
               In mammals, three main forms of autophagy have been described:
               macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone‐mediated autophagy
               (CMA). CMA is the only autophagic pathway that allows selective
               degradation of soluble proteins in lysosomes. In contrast to the
               other mammalian forms of autophagy, CMA does not require vesicle
               formation or major changes in the lysosomal membrane. Instead,
               substrate proteins directly cross the lysosomal membrane to
               reach the lumen, where they are rapidly degraded. The substrate
               proteins are targeted to the lysosomal membrane by recognition
               of a targeting motif (a KFERQ‐like motif), by a chaperone
               complex, consisting of hsc70 and its cochaperones, in the
               cytoplasm. Once at the lysosomal membrane, the protein interacts
               with a lysosomal receptor for this pathway, lysosomal associated
               membrane protein type 2A (LAMP‐2A), and it is translocated
               across the membrane into the lysosomal lumen assisted by a
               lysosome resident chaperone. These two
               characteristics---selectivity and direct substrate
               translocation---determine the particular role of CMA in
               different physiological and pathological conditions. In this

              with acute and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and B-cell
              lymphomas, but feasibility, toxicity, and response rates of
              consecutively enrolled patients treated with a consistent regimen
              and assessed on an intention-to-treat basis have not been
              reported. We aimed to define feasibility, toxicity, maximum
              tolerated dose, response rate, and biological correlates of
              response in children and young adults with refractory B-cell
              malignancies treated with CD19-CAR T cells. METHODS: This phase
              1, dose-escalation trial consecutively enrolled children and
              young adults (aged 1-30 years) with relapsed or refractory acute
              lymphoblastic leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Autologous T
              cells were engineered via an 11-day manufacturing process to
              express a CD19-CAR incorporating an anti-CD19 single-chain
              variable fragment plus TCR zeta and CD28 signalling domains. All
              patients received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide before a
              single infusion of CD19-CAR T cells. Using a standard 3 + 3
              design to establish the maximum tolerated dose, patients received
              either 1 $\times$ 10(6) CAR-transduced T cells per kg (dose 1), 3
              $\times$ 10(6) CAR-transduced T cells per kg (dose 2), or the
              entire CAR T-cell product if sufficient numbers of cells to meet
              the assigned dose were not generated. After the dose-escalation
              phase, an expansion cohort was treated at the maximum tolerated
              dose. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number
              NCT01593696. FINDINGS: Between July 2, 2012, and June 20, 2014,
              21 patients (including eight who had previously undergone
              allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation) were
              enrolled and infused with CD19-CAR T cells. 19 received the
              prescribed dose of CD19-CAR T cells, whereas the assigned dose
              concentration could not be generated for two patients (90\%
              feasible). All patients enrolled were assessed for response. The
              maximum tolerated dose was defined as 1 $\times$ 10(6) CD19-CAR T
              cells per kg. All toxicities were fully reversible, with the most
              severe being grade 4 cytokine release syndrome that occurred in
              three (14\%) of 21 patients (95\% CI 3·0-36·3). The most common
              non-haematological grade 3 adverse events were fever (nine [43\%]
              of 21 patients), hypokalaemia (nine [43\%] of 21 patients), fever

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The estimation of risk of recurrence for patients
              with colon carcinoma must be improved. A robust immune score
              quantification is needed to introduce immune parameters into
              cancer classification. The aim of the study was to assess the
              prognostic value of total tumour-infiltrating T-cell counts and
              cytotoxic tumour-infiltrating T-cells counts with the consensus
              Immunoscore assay in patients with stage I-III colon cancer.
              METHODS: An international consortium of 14 centres in 13
              countries, led by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer,
              assessed the Immunoscore assay in patients with TNM stage I-III
              colon cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to a training set,
              an internal validation set, or an external validation set.
              Paraffin sections of the colon tumour and invasive margin from
              each patient were processed by immunohistochemistry, and the
              densities of CD3+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumour and in
              the invasive margin were quantified by digital pathology. An
              Immunoscore for each patient was derived from the mean of four
              density percentiles. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the
              prognostic value of the Immunoscore for time to recurrence,
              defined as time from surgery to disease recurrence. Stratified
              multivariable Cox models were used to assess the associations
              between Immunoscore and outcomes, adjusting for potential
              confounders. Harrell's C-statistics was used to assess model
              performance. FINDINGS: Tissue samples from 3539 patients were
              processed, and samples from 2681 patients were included in the
              analyses after quality controls (700 patients in the training
              set, 636 patients in the internal validation set, and 1345
              patients in the external validation set). The Immunoscore assay
              showed a high level of reproducibility between observers and
              centres (r=0·97 for colon tumour; r=0·97 for invasive margin;
              p<0·0001). In the training set, patients with a high Immunoscore
              had the lowest risk of recurrence at 5 years (14 [8\%] patients
              with a high Immunoscore vs 65 (19\%) patients with an
              intermediate Immunoscore vs 51 (32\%) patients with a low
              Immunoscore; hazard ratio [HR] for high vs low Immunoscore 0·20,
              95\% CI 0·10-0·38; p<0·0001). The findings were confirmed in the
              two validation sets (n=1981). In the stratified Cox multivariable
              analysis, the Immunoscore association with time to recurrence was
              independent of patient age, sex, T stage, N stage, microsatellite
              instability, and existing prognostic factors (p<0·0001). Of 1434
              patients with stage II cancer, the difference in risk of
              recurrence at 5 years was significant (HR for high vs low
              Immunoscore 0·33, 95\% CI 0·21-0·52; p<0·0001), including in Cox
              multivariable analysis (p<0·0001). Immunoscore had the highest
              relative contribution to the risk of all clinical parameters,
              including the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for
              International Cancer Control TNM classification system.
              INTERPRETATION: The Immunoscore provides a reliable estimate of
              the risk of recurrence in patients with colon cancer. These
              results support the implementation of the consensus Immunoscore
              as a new component of a TNM-Immune classification of cancer.

  author   = "Gusev, Y and Kagansky, V and Dooley, W C",
  abstract = "A majority of tumor cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes,
              and this number varies even among the cells of clonal origin.
              Recent publications suggest that the acquisition of chromosome
              numerical abnormalities is an early event in a carcinogenesis
              pathway. Chromosomal instability may also play an important role
              in tumor progression. However, the mechanisms that result in
              abnormal number of chromosomes are poorly understood. One of the
              possible sources of chromosomal instability is a failure of
              chromosomes to segregate to the proper cells during cell
              division. We now propose a stochastic model that describes the
              evolution of chromosome number in a population of dividing cells
              as a result of such chromosome segregation errors (CSE). Assuming
              the independence of life cycles for all chromosomes within a
              cell, our model describes a process of evolution of cell
              karyotypes as a random branching walk in a K-dimensional
              nonnegative integer space (K = 23 for human cells). The
              conditions of cell death define K absorption boundaries for this
              random walk. Our basic model of human cells has all absorption
              boundaries set to zero. In the model, we have introduced a single
              parameter, a probability of segregation errors, which reflects an
              average rate of segregation errors per cell division. Using this
              model, we have examined the possible impact of CSE on chromosome
              numerical changes in cell populations. The model was implemented
              in a C++ program based on a discrete event simulation algorithm.
              Using computer simulation experiments, we have tested the
              sensitivity of our model to the initial conditions and parameter
              values. We have examined the effects of CSE on survival of cells
              and clones as well as on the dynamics of population growth and
              chromosome number distributions. Our modeling results suggest
              that the long-term dynamics of cell population growth depends
              upon the rate of segregation errors. The fraction of clones
              surviving was estimated as a function of the probability of CSE,
              and critical values for the probability of CSE were approximated
              which separates qualitatively different patterns of model
              behavior. The model suggests a theoretical limit for the rate of
              CSE that would allow a diploid population to survive without a
              complete loss of any chromosome type. It also suggests a minimal
              interval of probability of CSE values for which 100\% survival of
              clones is possible. Our modeling results allow comparisons to be",

  abstract = "A stochastic model of chromosomal instability has been previously
              developed which has included one adjustable parameter---the
              probability of a segregation error. Using computer simulations,
              we have previously analyzed this model and were able to reproduce
              a short-term dynamics of chromosome copy number distributions in
              clones of cancer cells. In a short run, segregation errors
              provide a continuous production of deviant cells with increasing
              variation of cell karyotypes, which depends upon the rate of
              segregation errors. In the long-term observations, many tumors
              and cancer cell lines have been observed to maintain a stable,
              although abnormal, distribution of chromosome number for hundreds
              of cell generations. This phenomenon of ``stability within
              instability'' presents an interesting paradox, which could be
              addressed mathematically. However, this would require modeling of
              long term growth of tumor cell clones for hundreds of
              generations, which has far exceeded capabilities of modern
              computer systems. In this study, we have analyzed asymptotic
              behavior of our model using a semianalytical approach. A
              transition probability matrix was derived analytically and
              implemented in a recursive algorithm for computational
              experiments. Using this transition probability model, the
              expected frequencies of chromosome copy number have been
              calculated under various initial and boundary conditions. We have
              also tested several alternative models, which describe various
              mechanisms of errors in segregation of chromosomes, and found
              conditions for stabilization of distribution of chromosomes copy
              numbers over a large number of cell generations. Stable clonal
              frequencies were estimated which are independent of initial
              conditions, i.e., chromosome copy numbers in the initiator cells.
              These stable distributions were, however, dependent on the model
              assumptions regarding particular mechanism of errors in
              segregation of chromosomes. Thus, our modeling results have
              suggested a possible connection between the form of stable
              distribution of chromosome numbers in tumors and the underlying
              mechanism of errors in segregation of chromosomes. This new
              analytical approach allows us to overcome technical impairments
              and limitations of computer simulation, and, for the first time,
              provides mathematical insight into long-term evolution of
              chromosome numerical changes in human tumors.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is a rare tumour with no established
              treatments once metastases develop. Although a variety of
              immune-based therapies have shown efficacy in metastatic
              cutaneous melanoma, their use in ocular variants has been
              disappointing. Recently, adoptive T-cell therapy has shown
              salvage responses in multiple refractory solid tumours. Thus, we
              sought to determine if adoptive transfer of autologous
              tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) could mediate regression
              of metastatic uveal melanoma. METHODS: In this ongoing
              single-centre, two-stage, phase 2, single-arm trial, patients
              (aged $\geq$16 years) with histologically confirmed metastatic
              ocular melanoma were enrolled. Key eligibility criteria were an
              Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1,
              progressive metastatic disease, and adequate haematological,
              renal, and hepatic function. Metastasectomies were done to
              procure tumour tissue to generate autologous TIL cultures, which
              then underwent large scale ex-vivo expansion. Patients were
              treated with lymphodepleting conditioning chemotherapy
              (intravenous cyclophosphamide [60 mg/kg] daily for 2 days
              followed by fludarabine [25 mg/m2] daily for 5 days, followed by
              a single intravenous infusion of autologous TILs and high-dose
              interleukin-2 [720 000 IU/kg] every 8 h). The primary endpoint
              was objective tumour response in evaluable patients per protocol
              using Response to Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version
              1.0. An interim analysis of this trial is reported here. The
              trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01814046.
              FINDINGS: From the completed first stage and ongoing expansion
              stage of this trial, a total of 21 consecutive patients with
              metastatic uveal melanoma were enrolled between June 7, 2013, and
              Sept 9, 2016, and received TIL therapy. Seven (35\%, 95\% CI
              16-59) of 20 evaluable patients had objective tumour regression.
              Among the responders, six patients achieved a partial response,
              two of which are ongoing and have not reached maximum response.
              One patient achieved complete response of numerous hepatic
              metastases, currently ongoing at 21 months post therapy. Three of
              the responders were refractory to previous immune checkpoint
              blockade. Common grade 3 or worse toxic effects were related to
              the lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen and included
              lymphopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia (21 [100\%]
              patients for each toxicity); anaemia (14 [67\%] patients); and
              infection (six [29\%] patients). There was one treatment-related
              death secondary to sepsis-induced multiorgan failure.
              INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first report
              describing adoptive transfer of autologous TILs to mediate
              objective tumour regression in patients with metastatic uveal
              melanoma. These initial results challenge the belief that
              metastatic uveal melanoma is immunotherapy resistant and support
              the further investigation of immune-based therapies for this
              cancer. Refinement of this T-cell therapy is crucial to improve
              the frequency of clinical responses and the general applicability
              of this treatment modality. FUNDING: Intramural Research Program

              the understanding and prediction of the outcome of intracellular

              functionality of the entire system? And, how should one go about

              lymphoid tissue using a cellular Potts model to characterize the
              functional response of CTL killing of target cells, and find that
              the total killing rate saturates both with the CTL and the target
              cell densities. The relative saturation in CTL and target cell
              densities is determined by whether a CTL can kill multiple target
              cells at the same time, and whether a target cell can be killed
              by many CTLs together. We find that all the studied regimes can
              be well described by a double-saturation (DS) function with two
              different saturation constants. We show that this DS model can be
              mechanistically derived for the cases where target cells are
              killed by a single CTL. For the other cases, a biological
              interpretation of the parameters is still possible. Our results
              imply that this DS function can be used as a tool to predict the
              cellular interactions in cytotoxicity data.",

  abstract = "Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated killing involves the
              formation of a synapse with a target cell, followed by delivery
              of perforin and granzymes. Previously, we derived a general
              functional response for CTL killing while considering that CTLs
              form stable synapses (i.e., single-stage) and that the number of
              conjugates remains at steady state. However, the killing of
              target cells sometimes requires multiple engagements (i.e.,
              multistage). To study how multistage killing and a lack of steady
              state influence the functional response, we here analyze a set of
              differential equations as well as simulations employing the
              cellular Potts model, in both cases describing CTLs that kill
              target cells. We find that at steady state the total killing rate
              (i.e., the number of target cells killed by all CTLs) is well
              described by the previously derived double saturation function.
              Compared to single-stage killing, the total killing rate during
              multistage killing saturates at higher CTL and target cell
              densities. Importantly, when the killing is measured before the
              steady state is approached, a qualitatively different functional
              response emerges for two reasons: First, the killing signal of
              each CTL gets diluted over several targets and because this
              dilution effect is strongest at high target cell densities; this
              can result in a peak in the dependence of the total killing rate
              on the target cell density. Second, the total killing rate
              exhibits a sigmoid dependence on the CTL density when killing is
              a multistage process, because it takes typically more than one
              CTL to kill a target. In conclusion, a sigmoid dependence of the
              killing rate on the CTLs during initial phases of killing may be
              indicative of a multistage killing process. Observation of a
              sigmoid functional response may thus arise from a dilution effect
              and is not necessarily due to cooperative behavior of the CTLs.",

              activate tumor-specific immunity and have shown remarkable
              efficacy in the treatment of melanoma. Yet, little is known about
              tumor cell-intrinsic PD-1 pathway effects. Here, we show that
              murine and human melanomas contain PD-1-expressing cancer
              subpopulations and demonstrate that melanoma cell-intrinsic PD-1
              promotes tumorigenesis, even in mice lacking adaptive immunity.
              PD-1 inhibition on melanoma cells by RNAi, blocking antibodies,
              or mutagenesis of melanoma-PD-1 signaling motifs suppresses tumor
              growth in immunocompetent, immunocompromised, and PD-1-deficient
              tumor graft recipient mice. Conversely, melanoma-specific PD-1
              overexpression enhances tumorigenicity, as does engagement of
              melanoma-PD-1 by its ligand, PD-L1, whereas melanoma-PD-L1
              inhibition or knockout of host-PD-L1 attenuate growth of
              PD-1-positive melanomas. Mechanistically, the melanoma-PD-1
              receptor modulates downstream effectors of mTOR signaling. Our
              results identify melanoma cell-intrinsic functions of the
              PD-1:PD-L1 axis in tumor growth and suggest that blocking
              melanoma-PD-1 might contribute to the striking clinical efficacy

              Here, we identify conserved intratumoral CD4 and CD8 T cell
              behaviors in scRNA-seq data from 25 melanoma patients. We

              independence from the transitional and dysfunctional cell states.
              Notably, we demonstrate that dysfunctional T cells are the major

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Blocking the interaction between the programmed cell
              death (PD)-1 protein and one of its ligands, PD-L1, has been
              reported to have impressive antitumor responses. Therapeutics
              targeting this pathway are currently in clinical trials.
              Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are the first of this anti-PD-1
              pathway family of checkpoint inhibitors to gain accelerated
              approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
              treatment of ipilimumab-refractory melanoma. Nivolumab has been
              associated with improved overall survival compared with
              dacarbazine in patients with previously untreated wild-type
              serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf proto-oncogene BRAF
              melanoma. Although the most mature data are in the treatment of
              melanoma, the FDA has granted approval of nivolumab for squamous
              cell lung cancer and the breakthrough therapy designation to
              immune- checkpoint inhibitors for use in other cancers:
              nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, for Hodgkin
              lymphoma, and MPDL-3280A, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, for
              bladder cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Here we review the
              literature on PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade and focus on the reported
              clinical studies that have included patients with melanoma.
              METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify relevant clinical
              studies of PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapies in melanoma. A review of
              data from the current trials on clinicaltrial.gov was
              incorporated, as well as data presented in abstracts at the 2014
              annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,
              given the limited number of published clinical trials on this
              topic. FINDINGS: The anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 agents have been
              reported to have impressive antitumor effects in several
              malignancies, including melanoma. The greatest clinical activity
              in unselected patients has been seen in melanoma. Tumor
              expression of PD-L1 is a suggestive, but inadequate, biomarker
              predictive of response to immune-checkpoint blockade. However,
              tumors expressing little or no PD-L1 are less likely to respond
              to PD-1 pathway blockade. Combination checkpoint blockade with
              PD-1 plus cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)-4 blockade
              appears to improve response rates in patients who are less likely
              to respond to single-checkpoint blockade. Toxicity with PD-1
              blocking agents is less than the toxicity with previous
              immunotherapies (eg, interleukin 2, CTLA-4 blockade). Certain
              adverse events can be severe and potentially life threatening,
              but most can be prevented or reversed with close monitoring and
              appropriate management. IMPLICATIONS: This family of
              immune-checkpoint inhibitors benefits not only patients with
              metastatic melanoma but also those with historically less
              responsive tumor types. Although a subset of patients responds to
              single-agent blockade, the initial trial of checkpoint-inhibitor
              combinations has reported a potential to improve response rates.
              Combination therapies appear to be a means of increasing response
              rates, albeit with increased immune-related adverse events. As
              these treatments become available to patients, education
              regarding the recognition and management of immune-related
              effects of immune-checkpoint blockade will be essential for
              maximizing clinical benefit.",

              produce glutamine. Increased glutamine catabolism in MYC-induced
              liver tumors is associated with decreased levels of glutamine
              synthetase (Glul) and the switch from Gls2 to Gls1 glutaminase.
              In contrast to liver tumors, MYC-induced lung tumors display

              immunological synapse is a critical requirement for multiple
              facets of cytotoxic function. Activating receptor and integrin
              signaling leads to the regulated turnover and remodeling of
              actin, which is required for adhesion, sustained receptor
              signaling, and ultimately exocytosis. NK cells undergo lytic
              granule exocytosis in hypodense regions of a pervasive actin
              network. Although these requirements have been well demonstrated,
              neither the dynamic regulation of synaptic actin nor its specific
              function, however, has been determined at a nanoscale level.
              Here, live-cell super-resolution microscopy demonstrates
              nanoscale filamentous actin dynamism in NK cell lytic granule
              secretion. Following cell spreading, the overall content of the

              filament displacement leads to stochastic clearance formation and

              autophagy in the Drosophila fat body. In contrast, TOR's
              downstream effector S6K promotes rather than suppresses
              autophagy, suggesting S6K downregulation may limit autophagy
              during extended starvation. Despite the catabolic potential of
              autophagy, disruption of conserved components of the autophagic
              machinery, including ATG1 and ATG5, does not restore growth to
              TOR mutant cells. Instead, inhibition of autophagy enhances TOR
              mutant phenotypes, including reduced cell size, growth rate, and
              survival. Thus, in cells lacking TOR, autophagy plays a
              protective role that is dominant over its potential role as a
              growth suppressor.",

              particularly sensitive to the induction of mitotic catastrophe.
              Resistance to cell death is also closely linked to genomic
              instability, as it enables malignant cells to expand even in a
              stressful environment. Currently it is known that cells can die

              preceding apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the expression
              and/or proper function of several proteins. Mitotic catastrophe
              was proposed to be an onco-suppressive mechanism and the evasion

              pathways, has revolutionized cancer therapeutics. Despite the
              significant progress in cancer therapy, clinical oncologists are
              often facing the primary impediment of anticancer drug
              resistance, as many cancer patients display either intrinsic
              chemoresistance from the very beginning of the therapy or after
              initial responses and upon repeated drug treatment cycles,
              acquired drug resistance develops and thus relapse emerges,
              resulting in increased mortality. Our attempts to understand the
              molecular basis underlying these drug resistance phenotypes in
              pre-clinical models and patient specimens revealed the extreme
              plasticity and adaptive pathways employed by tumor cells, being

              important feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer
              therapeutics: both tumour shrinkage (objective response) and
              disease progression are useful endpoints in clinical trials.
              Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators,
              cooperative groups, industry and government authorities have
              adopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes.
              However, a number of questions and issues have arisen which have
              led to the development of a revised RECIST guideline (version
              1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this
              special issue, has come from assessment of a large data warehouse
              (>6500 patients), simulation studies and literature reviews.
              HIGHLIGHTS OF REVISED RECIST 1.1: Major changes include: Number
              of lesions to be assessed: based on evidence from numerous trial
              databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis purposes, the
              number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response
              determination has been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum
              of five total (and from five to two per organ, maximum).
              Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes
              with a short axis of 15 mm are considered measurable and
              assessable as target lesions. The short axis measurement should
              be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of tumour
              response. Nodes that shrink to <10mm short axis are considered
              normal. Confirmation of response is required for trials with
              response primary endpoint but is no longer required in randomised
              studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of
              interpretation of data. Disease progression is clarified in
              several aspects: in addition to the previous definition of
              progression in target disease of 20\% increase in sum, a 5mm
              absolute increase is now required as well to guard against over
              calling PD when the total sum is very small. Furthermore, there
              is guidance offered on what constitutes 'unequivocal progression'
              of non-measurable/non-target disease, a source of confusion in
              the original RECIST guideline. Finally, a section on detection of
              new lesions, including the interpretation of FDG-PET scan
              assessment is included. Imaging guidance: the revised RECIST
              includes a new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on
              the optimal anatomical assessment of lesions. FUTURE WORK: A key
              question considered by the RECIST Working Group in developing
              RECIST 1.1 was whether it was appropriate to move from anatomic
              unidimensional assessment of tumour burden to either volumetric
              anatomical assessment or to functional assessment with PET or
              MRI. It was concluded that, at present, there is not sufficient
              standardisation or evidence to abandon anatomical assessment of
              tumour burden. The only exception to this is in the use of
              FDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progression. As
              is detailed in the final paper in this special issue, the use of
              these promising newer approaches requires appropriate clinical
              validation studies.",

              Soon after the discovery of angiogenic factors and their

              Additional evidences came from pre-malignant lesions of glandular
              epithelia, in which the angiogenic switch was demonstrated by the
              immunohistochemical expression of VEGF in gastric metaplasia and

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Vascular calcification is a characteristic feature of
              atherosclerosis and is considered as an independent predictor of
              cardiovascular risk. CD137 signaling has previously shown to be
              involved in atherosclerosis. However, the possible role of CD137
              signaling in regulation of vascular calcification has not been
              reported. In the present study, we investigated the effect of
              CD137 signaling on vascular calcification in ApoE-/- mice and in
              vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of mice. METHODS: Calcium
              deposition and muscle fibers in vivo or vitro were identified by
              von-Kossa and Masson's trichrome staining respectively. Alkaline
              phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured by the ALP assay Kit. The
              presence of bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP2) and runt-related
              transcription factor 2 (Runx2) was detected by real-time PCR,
              Western blot and immunofluorescence in vitro or vivo. RESULTS:
              Our data shows that activation of CD137 signaling by
              intraperitoneal injection of agonist-CD137 antibody increased the
              areas of vascular calcification. Activation of CD137 signaling
              also increased the expression of BMP2 and Runx2 in the
              atherosclerotic plaques. In vitro, activation of CD137 signaling
              also aggravated VSMC calcification, while blocking CD137
              signaling could alleviate agonist-CD137 induced VSMC
              calcification. In addition, the levels of calcium, BMP2 and
              Runx2, indicators of calcification, were all significantly
              elevated in agonist-CD137 group in VSMCs. CONCLUSION: Our data
              revealed a previously unrecognized role of CD137 signaling in
              vascular calcification in vivo and vitro and provides a novel
              target for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis in the

              elucidated. We found significant differences in mutational
              patterns, chromosomal instability, and gene expression that
              correlated with patient microsatellite instability status. A
              prominent immune gene expression was observed in
              microsatellite-instable (MSI) tumors, as well as in a subgroup of
              microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. MSI tumors had increased
              frameshift mutations, showed genetic evidence of immunoediting,
              had higher densities of Th1, effector-memory T cells, in situ
              proliferating T cells, and inhibitory PD1-PDL1 cells, had high
              Immunoscores, and were infiltrated with mutation-specific
              cytotoxic T cells. Multivariate analysis revealed that
              Immunoscore was superior to microsatellite instability in
              predicting patients' disease-specific recurrence and survival.
              These findings indicate that assessment of the immune status via
              Immunoscore provides a potent indicator of tumor recurrence
              beyond microsatellite-instability staging that could be an
              important guide for immunotherapy strategies.",

              ligation leads to unique epigenetic, transcriptional, and

              CD28 and its ligands in both effector and regulatory T cells.
              CD28 is critical for regulatory T cell survival and the
              maintenance of immune homeostasis. We outline the roles that CD28

              experiments have generally tried to estimate the required period
              of opportunity for T cell stimulation rather than the duration of
              individual T cell-DC interactions. Since the application of
              multi-photon microscopy (MPM) to living lymphoid tissues, the
              interactions between immune cells, as well as the duration
              thereof, can directly be observed in vivo. Indeed, long-lasting
              interactions between T cells and DCs were shown to be important
              for the onset of immune responses. However, because MPM imaging
              is typically restricted to experiments lasting 1 h, and because T
              cell-DC conjugates frequently move into and out of the imaged
              volume, it is difficult to estimate the true duration of

              neural network, that takes environmental variables as an input
              and from these determines the cellular behaviour as the output.
              The response of the network is determined by connection weights
              and thresholds in the network, which are subject to mutations
              when the cells divide. As both available space and nutrients are
              limited resources for the tumour, this gives rise to clonal
              evolution where only the fittest cells survive. Using this
              approach we have investigated the impact of the tissue oxygen
              concentration on the growth and evolutionary dynamics of the

              rise to a tumour with a fingered morphology that contains
              aggressive phenotypes with a small apoptotic potential, while a
              high oxygen concentration in the tissue gives rise to a tumour
              with a round morphology containing less evolved phenotypes. The

              and the immune system is presented. The equations and parameters
              of the model are based on experimental and clinical results from
              published studies. The model includes the primary cell
              populations involved in effector T-cell mediated tumor killing:
              regulatory T cells, helper T cells, and dendritic cells. A key
              feature is the inclusion of multiple mechanisms of
              immunosuppression through the main cytokines and growth factors
              mediating the interactions between the cell populations.
              Decreased access of effector cells to the tumor interior with
              increasing tumor size is accounted for. The model is applied to
              tumors with different growth rates and antigenicities to gauge
              the relative importance of various immunosuppressive mechanisms.
              The most important factors leading to tumor escape are
              TGF-$\beta$-induced immunosuppression, conversion of helper T
              cells into regulatory T cells, and the limitation of immune cell
              access to the full tumor at large tumor sizes. The results
              suggest that for a given tumor growth rate, there is an optimal
              antigenicity maximizing the response of the immune system.
              Further increases in antigenicity result in increased
              immunosuppression, and therefore a decrease in tumor killing
              rate. This result may have implications for immunotherapies which

              understood. Subtle differences in how a given strain interacts
              with the immune system are likely a key factor in determining
              virulence. One aspect of the interaction is the ability of T
              cells to locate the foci of the infection in time to prevent
              uncontrolled expansion. Here, we develop an agent based spatial
              model to focus on T cell migration from lymph nodes through the
              vascular system to sites of infection. We use our model to
              investigate whether different strains of influenza modulate this

              secretion rates we measure in vitro together with values taken

              challenges for T cell recruitment that are not apparent in
              standard differential equation models. In this model comparing
              three influenza viruses, plaque expansion is governed primarily
              by the replication rate of the virus strain, and the efficiency
              of the T cell search-and-kill is limited by the density of
              infected epithelial cells in each plaque. Thus for each virus
              there is a different threshold of T cell search time above which
              recruited T cells are unable to control further expansion. Future

              knowledge of the tumor's specific biologic characteristics, and
              many patients may not benefit. In vitro chemotherapy resistance
              is associated with clinical unresponsiveness in some tumors, and
              in lung cancer, chemotherapy resistance is prevalent.
              Multiple-agent chemotherapy resistance and association of
              chemotherapy resistance with molecular markers are described.
              METHODS: Chemotherapy resistance to doublets--carboplatin and
              paclitaxel, cisplatin and navelbline, cisplatin and docetaxel,
              and cisplatin and gemcitabine--was analyzed in 4571 non-small
              cell lung cancer tumors with the extreme drug resistance assay.
              Chemotherapy resistance is defined as follows: extreme drug
              resistance, 1 SD above the median chemotherapy resistance;
              intermediate drug resistance, between the median and extreme drug
              resistances; and low drug resistance, 1 SD below the median.
              Chemotherapy resistance was compared with DNA ploidy measured by
              flow cytometry, and markers p53 and epithelial growth factor
              receptor were assayed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Tumors
              with extreme or intermediate drug resistance were noted in 30\%
              to carboplatin-paclitaxel, in 24\% to cisplatin-navelbline, in
              42\% to cisplatin-gemcitabine, and in 27\% to
              cisplatin-docetaxel. Extreme or intermediate drug resistance to
              at least one drug occurred in 74\% to carboplatin-paclitaxel, in
              68\% to cisplatin-navelbline, in 88\% to cisplatin-gemcitabine,
              and in 68\% to cisplatin-docetaxel. More intermediate plus
              extreme chemotherapy resistances occurred in aneuploid tumors to
              etoposide (53\% vs 36\%, P = .0002) and topotecan (48\% vs 36\%,
              P = .0094), with less intermediate or extreme chemotherapy
              resistance to gemcitabine (88\% vs 81\%, P = .0345). p53-Positive
              tumors had more intermediate or extreme resistance to etoposide
              (57\% vs 44\%, P = .0009) and doxorubicin (73\% vs. 58\%, P =
              .0324) and less intermediate or extreme resistance to cisplatin
              (44\% vs 54\%, P = .0125), to carboplatin (47\% vs 57\%, P =
              .0129), to taxol (47\% vs 57\%, P = .0056), and to gemcitabine
              (78\% vs 87\%, P = .0108). Fewer epithelial growth factor

              whether there are gene architectures that optimize this process.
              We measured fitness of ∼14,000 E. coli strains, each expressing a
              reporter gene with a unique 5' architecture. By comparing
              cost-effective and ineffective architectures, we found that cost
              per protein molecule could be minimized by lowering transcription
              levels, regulating translation speeds, and utilizing amino acids
              that are cheap to synthesize and that are less hydrophobic. We

  abstract = "Theories organize knowledge and construct objectivity by framing
              observations and experiments. The elaboration of theoretical
              principles is examined in the light of the rich interactions
              between physics and mathematics. These two disciplines share
              common principles of construction of concepts and of the proper
              objects of inquiry. Theory construction in physics relies on
              mathematical symmetries that preserve the key invariants observed
              and proposed by such theory; these invariants buttress the idea
              that the objects of physics are generic and thus interchangeable
              and they move along specific trajectories which are uniquely
              determined, in classical and relativistic physics. In contrast to
              physics, biology is a historical science that centers on the
              changes that organisms experience while undergoing ontogenesis
              and phylogenesis. Biological objects, namely organisms, are not
              generic but specific; they are individuals. The incessant changes
              they undergo represent the breaking of symmetries, and thus the
              opposite of symmetry conservation, a central component of
              physical theories. This instability corresponds to the changes of
              the environment and the phenotypes. Inspired by Galileo's
              principle of inertia, the ``default state'' of inert matter, we
              propose a ``default state'' for biological dynamics following
              Darwin's first principle, ``descent with modification'' that we
              transform into ``proliferation with variation and motility'' as a
              property that spans life, including cells in an organism. These
              dissimilarities between theories of the inert and of biology also
              apply to causality: biological causality is to be understood in
              relation to the distinctive role that constraints assume in this
              discipline. Consequently, the notion of cause will be reframed in
              a context where constraints to activity are seen as the core
              component of biological analyses. Finally, we assert that the
              radical materiality of life rules out distinctions such as

              considerable interest as therapeutic target for tumors with the
              9p21 deletion. This gene maps to 9p21 and loss of this
              chromosomal region in tumors offers an unique opportunity for
              chemoselective treatment, since MTAP is an important salvage
              enzyme for the formation of adenine that is needed for DNA
              synthesis. L-Alanosine, an antibiotic from Streptomyces
              alanosinicus, blocks the common de novo purine biosynthesis
              pathway and, thereby, inhibits tumor cells with MTAP deficiency.
              Normal cells escape the detrimental effects of L-alanosine due to
              their proficiency in the MTAP salvage pathway. The present
              analysis was undertaken to gain insights into the molecular
              architecture of tumor cells that determines the response to
              L-alanosine apart from the MTAP gene. Analysis of cell doubling
              times and IC(50) values for L-alanosine showed that slowly

              genes or expressed sequence tags whose mRNA expression correlated
              with the IC(50) values for L-alanosine. Furthermore, we tested
              L-alanosine for cross-resistance in multidrug-resistant cell
              lines which overexpress selectively either the

  abstract = "The heat shock or stress response is one of the most highly
              conserved adaptive responses in nature. In single cell organisms,
              the stress response confers tolerance to a variety of stresses
              including hyperthermia, hyperoxia, hypoxia, and other
              perturbations, which alter protein synthesis. This tolerance
              phenomenon is also extremely important in the multicellular
              organism, resulting in not only thermal tolerance, but also
              resistance to stresses of the whole organism such as
              ischemia-reperfusion injury. Moreover, recent data indicates that
              these stress proteins have the ability to modulate the cellular
              immune response. Although the terms heat shock proteins (HSPs)
              and stress proteins are often used interchangeably, the term
              stress proteins includes the HSPs, the glucose-regulated proteins
              (GRPs) and ubiquitin. The stress proteins may be grouped by
              molecular weight ranging from the large 110 kDa HSP110 to
              ubiquitin at 8 kDa. These proteins serve as cellular chaperones,
              participating in protein synthesis and transport through the
              various cellular compartments. Because these proteins have unique
              cellular localizations, the chaperone function of the stress
              proteins often involves a transfer of peptides between stress
              proteins as the peptide is moved between cellular compartments.
              For example, HSP70 is a cytosolic and nuclear chaperone, which is
              critical for the transfer of cellular peptides in the
              mitochondrion through a hand-off that involves mitochondrial
              HSP60 at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Similarly, cytosolic
              proteins are transferred from HSP70 to gp96 as they move into the
              endoplasmic reticulum. The central role of the stress proteins in
              the transfer of peptides through the cell may be responsible for
              the recently recognized importance of the stress proteins in the
              modulation of the immune system [Feder, M.E., Hofmann, G.E.,
              1999. Heat-shock proteins, molecular chaperones, and the stress
              response: evolutionary and ecological physiology. Annu. Rev.
              Physiol. 61, 243-282.]. This importance in immune regulation is
              best addressed using Matzinger's model of the immune response -
              The Danger Theory of Immunity [Matzinger, P., Fuchs, E.J., 1996.
              Beyond self and non-self: immunity is a conversation, not a war.
              J. NIH Res. 8, 35-39.]. Matzinger suggests that an immune system
              model based on the differentiation between ``self and non-self''
              does not easily account for the changes that occur in the
              organism with growth and development. Why, for example does an
              organism not self-destruct when the immune system encounters the
              myriad of new peptides generated at puberty? Instead, she
              proposes a model of immune function based on the ability to
              detect and address dangers. This model states that the basic
              function of all cells of the organism is appropriately timed
              death ``from natural causes''. This type of cell death, or
              apoptosis, generates no stress signals. If, on the other hand, a
              cell is ``murdered'' by an infectious agent or dies an untimely
              death due to necrosis or ischemia, the cell undergoes a stress
              response with the liberation of stress protein-peptide complexes
              into the extracellular environment upon cell lysis. Not only do
              they serve as a ``danger signal'' to alert the immune system to
              the death of a cell under stress, but their role as protein
              carriers allows the immune effector cells to survey the peptides
              released by this stressed cell and to activate against new or
              unrecognized peptides carried by the stress protein. Matzinger
              bases the Danger Theory of Immunity on three ``Laws of
              Lymphotics''. These laws state that: (1) resting T lymphocytes
              require both antigen stimulation by an antigen-presenting cell
              (APC) and co-stimulation with a danger signal to become
              activated; (2) the co-stimulatory signal must be received through
              the APC; and (3) T cells receiving only antigen stimulation
              without the co-stimulatory signal undergo apoptosis. The Danger
              Theory gives a simple model for both tolerance and activation.

              addresses tumor formation. The logistic equation, phi(n)(+1) =

              aneuploidy in vivo and in vitro. The variable phi(n)(+1) is the
              average aneuploid fraction of a population of cells at the n+1
              cell division and is determined by the value at the nth cell

              of the logistic equation shows that: 1) an aneuploid fraction of
              at least 0.30 is necessary to sustain a population of cancer

              epithelial cells that grow continuously in tissue culture

              mosmol/kg by adding NaCl or urea, but only after a growth arrest
              of approximately 24 h. At a higher osmolality (650-700 mosmol/kg)
              most cells die within hours by apoptosis. The cells both in vitro
              and in vivo adapt to high osmolality by a number of mechanisms,
              including accumulation of variety of organic osmolytes and
              induction of heat shock proteins. The cell cycle delay results
              from blocks at the G1 and G2/M checkpoints and slowing during S.
              After adding NaCl, but not urea, the amount and transcriptional
              activity of p53 (the tumor suppressor protein) increases. The p53
              is phosphorylated on ser-15 and is transcriptionally active at

              population who benefit from this treatment is unknown. METHODS:
              Advanced melanoma patients with accessible tumours had biopsy
              performed before the start of treatment with ADI-PEG20 and at the
              time of progression or relapse when amenable to determine whether
              argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) expression in tumour was
              predictive of response to ADI-PEG20. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of
              thirty-eight patients treated had melanoma tumours assessable for
              ASS staining before treatment. Clinical benefit rate (CBR) and
              longer time to progression were associated with negative
              expression of tumour ASS. Only 1 of 10 patients with ASS-positive
              tumours (ASS+) had stable disease, whereas 4 of 17 (24\%) had
              partial response and 5 had stable disease, when ASS expression
              was negative (ASS-), giving CBR rates of 52.9 vs 10\%, P=0.041.
              Two responding patients with negative ASS expression before
              therapy had rebiopsy after tumour progression and the ASS
              expression became positive. The survival of ASS- patients

  abstract = "Mitotic catastrophe (MC) has long been considered as a mode of
              cell death that results from premature or inappropriate entry of
              cells into mitosis and can be caused by chemical or physical
              stresses. Whereas it initially was depicted as the main form of
              cell death induced by ionizing radiation, it is today known to be
              triggered also by treatment with agents influencing the stability
              of microtubule, various anticancer drugs and mitotic failure
              caused by defective cell cycle checkpoints. Although various
              descriptions explaining MC exist, there is still no general
              accepted definition of this phenomenon. Here, we present
              evidences indicating that death-associated MC is not a separate
              mode of cell death, rather a process ('prestage') preceding cell
              death, which can occur through necrosis or apoptosis. The final
              outcome of MC depends on the molecular profile of the cell.",

              indispensable factors in the body's ongoing defence against viral
              infection and tumor development. CTL/NK cells recognize and kill
              infected or aberrant target cells by two major pathways: either
              through introduction of a battery of proteases - called granzymes
              - to the target cell cytosol, or through TNF
              superfamily-dependent killing. During granzyme-dependent killing,
              target cell death is quick and efficient and is mediated by
              multiple granzymes, acting via redundant cell death pathways.
              Although granzyme-mediated cell death has been intensively

              correlates with the presence of extra centrosomes. However, a
              direct mechanistic link between extra centrosomes and CIN has not
              been established. It has been proposed that extra centrosomes
              generate CIN by promoting multipolar anaphase, a highly abnormal
              division that produces three or more aneuploid daughter cells.
              Here we use long-term live-cell imaging to demonstrate that cells
              with multiple centrosomes rarely undergo multipolar cell
              divisions, and the progeny of these divisions are typically
              inviable. Thus, multipolar divisions cannot explain observed
              rates of CIN. In contrast, we observe that CIN cells with extra
              centrosomes routinely undergo bipolar cell divisions, but display
              a significantly increased frequency of lagging chromosomes during
              anaphase. To define the mechanism underlying this mitotic defect,
              we generated cells that differ only in their centrosome number.
              We demonstrate that extra centrosomes alone are sufficient to
              promote chromosome missegregation during bipolar cell division.
              These segregation errors are a consequence of cells passing
              through a transient 'multipolar spindle intermediate' in which
              merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors accumulate
              before centrosome clustering and anaphase. These findings provide

              strains largely scale with chromosome copy numbers, following the

              aneuploidy confers diverse phenotypes. We designed a novel scheme

              producing 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) from $\alpha$-ketoglutarate.
              Here we report that 2HG-producing IDH mutants can prevent the

              progenitor cells to differentiate into terminally differentiated
              cells. In tumour samples from glioma patients, IDH mutations were
              associated with a distinct gene expression profile enriched for
              genes expressed in neural progenitor cells, and this was
              associated with increased histone methylation. To test whether
              the ability of IDH mutants to promote histone methylation
              contributes to a block in cell differentiation in non-transformed
              cells, we tested the effect of neomorphic IDH mutants on
              adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Introduction of either mutant
              IDH or cell-permeable 2HG was associated with repression of the

              and a block to differentiation. This correlated with a
              significant increase in repressive histone methylation marks
              without observable changes in promoter DNA methylation. Gliomas
              were found to have elevated levels of similar histone repressive
              marks. Stable transfection of a 2HG-producing mutant IDH into
              immortalized astrocytes resulted in progressive accumulation of

              methylation reproducibly preceded a rise in DNA methylation as
              cells were passaged in culture. Furthermore, we found that the

              adipocyte differentiation, and that RNA-interference suppression
              of KDM4C was sufficient to block differentiation. Together these
              data demonstrate that 2HG can inhibit histone demethylation and

              Glioblastomas and other cancers with the CpG island methylator
              phenotype (CIMP) constitute a subset of tumours with extensive
              epigenomic aberrations and a distinct biology. Glioma CIMP
              (G-CIMP) is a powerful determinant of tumour pathogenicity, but
              the molecular basis of G-CIMP remains unresolved. Here we show
              that mutation of a single gene, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1

              stress associated with tumour growth and to satisfy the anabolic
              demands of proliferation. The tumour suppressor protein p53 (also
              known as TP53) influences a range of cellular metabolic
              processes, including glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation,
              glutaminolysis and anti-oxidant response. In contrast to its role
              in promoting apoptosis during DNA-damaging stress, p53 can
              promote cell survival during metabolic stress, a function that
              may contribute not only to tumour suppression but also to
              non-cancer-associated functions of p53. Here we show that human
              cancer cells rapidly use exogenous serine and that serine
              deprivation triggered activation of the serine synthesis pathway
              and rapidly suppressed aerobic glycolysis, resulting in an
              increased flux to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Transient p53-p21

              cell survival by efficiently channelling depleted serine stores
              to glutathione synthesis, thus preserving cellular anti-oxidant
              capacity. Cells lacking p53 failed to complete the response to
              serine depletion, resulting in oxidative stress, reduced

              might reveal cancer cell liabilities that can be exploited for
              therapeutic benefit. Here we developed a continuous-flow culture
              apparatus (Nutrostat) for maintaining proliferating cells in
              low-nutrient media for long periods of time, and used it to
              undertake competitive proliferation assays on a pooled collection
              of barcoded cancer cell lines cultured in low-glucose conditions.
              Sensitivity to low glucose varies amongst cell lines, and an RNA
              interference (RNAi) screen pinpointed mitochondrial oxidative

              Chemotherapy is still the standard of care. Patient outcomes,
              especially for those in whom chemotherapy is not effective or is
              poorly tolerated, remain poor. One hallmark of UBC is the
              presence of high rates of somatic mutations. These alterations
              may enhance the ability of the host immune system to recognize
              tumour cells as foreign owing to an increased number of antigens.
              However, these cancers may also elude immune surveillance and
              eradication through the expression of programmed death-ligand 1
              (PD-L1; also called CD274 or B7-H1) in the tumour
              microenvironment. Therefore, we examined the anti-PD-L1 antibody
              MPDL3280A, a systemic cancer immunotherapy, for the treatment of
              metastatic UBC. MPDL3280A is a high-affinity engineered human
              anti-PD-L1 monoclonal immunoglobulin-G1 antibody that inhibits
              the interaction of PD-L1 with PD-1 (PDCD1) and B7.1 (CD80).
              Because PD-L1 is expressed on activated T cells, MPDL3280A was
              engineered with a modification in the Fc domain that eliminates
              antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity at clinically relevant
              doses to prevent the depletion of T cells expressing PD-L1. Here
              we show that MPDL3280A has noteworthy activity in metastatic UBC.
              Responses were often rapid, with many occurring at the time of
              the first response assessment (6 weeks) and nearly all were
              ongoing at the data cutoff. This phase I expansion study, with an
              adaptive design that allowed for biomarker-positive enriched
              cohorts, demonstrated that tumours expressing PD-L1-positive
              tumour-infiltrating immune cells had particularly high response
              rates. Moreover, owing to the favourable toxicity profile,
              including a lack of renal toxicity, patients with UBC, who are
              often older and have a higher incidence of renal impairment, may
              be better able to tolerate MPDL3280A versus chemotherapy. These
              results suggest that MPDL3280A may have an important role in

              evolutionary adaptation. This could occur through complex effects
              on the frequency or fitness of beneficial mutations. For example,
              in diverse cell types and organisms, immediately after a
              whole-genome duplication, newly formed polyploids missegregate
              chromosomes and undergo genetic instability. The instability
              following whole-genome duplications is thought to provide
              adaptive mutations in microorganisms and can promote
              tumorigenesis in mammalian cells. Polyploidy may also affect
              adaptation independently of beneficial mutations through
              ploidy-specific changes in cell physiology. Here we perform in

              sequencing and phenotypic analyses of evolved clones. Chromosome
              aneuploidy, concerted chromosome loss, and point mutations all

              within a large tumour often contains the same core set of genetic

              the yeast ATG1 kinase has an essential role in autophagy
              induction. Furthermore, autophagy is promoted by AMP activated
              protein kinase (AMPK), which is a key energy sensor and regulates
              cellular metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis. Conversely,
              autophagy is inhibited by the mammalian target of rapamycin

              mechanism for regulation of the mammalian autophagy-initiating
              kinase Ulk1, a homologue of yeast ATG1. Under glucose starvation,
              AMPK promotes autophagy by directly activating Ulk1 through

              sufficiency, high mTOR activity prevents Ulk1 activation by
              phosphorylating Ulk1 Ser 757 and disrupting the interaction
              between Ulk1 and AMPK. This coordinated phosphorylation is
              important for Ulk1 in autophagy induction. Our study has revealed

              cycles, for which there are many variants, are widespread in
              protozoa, plants and animals. Endocycling cells can achieve
              ploidies of >200,000 C (chromatin-value); this increase in

              facilitate the construction of very large cells or enhance
              macromolecular secretion. These cells execute normal S phases,
              using a G1-S regulatory apparatus similar to the one used by
              mitotic cells, but their capability to segregate chromosomes has
              been suppressed, typically by downregulation of mitotic
              cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Endocycles probably evolved
              many times, and the various endocycle mechanisms found in nature

              and liver failure in mice. Moreover, along with others, we have
              shown that TNF$\alpha$ is capable of sensitizing cells to FasL-

              activation and phosphorylation/activation of the BH3-only protein

              tumours are unknown. Here, we assessed proliferation of a
              collection of cancer cells following inhibition of the
              mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), a major metabolic
              pathway requiring molecular oxygen5. Sensitivity to ETC
              inhibition varied across cell lines, and subsequent metabolomic
              analysis uncovered aspartate availability as a major determinant
              of sensitivity. Cell lines least sensitive to ETC inhibition
              maintain aspartate levels by importing it through an
              aspartate/glutamate transporter, SLC1A3. Genetic or pharmacologic
              modulation of SLC1A3 activity markedly altered cancer cell
              sensitivity to ETC inhibitors. Interestingly, aspartate levels
              also decrease under low oxygen, and increasing aspartate import
              by SLC1A3 provides a competitive advantage to cancer cells at low
              oxygen levels and in tumour xenografts. Finally, aspartate levels
              in primary human tumours negatively correlate with the expression
              of hypoxia markers, suggesting that tumour hypoxia is sufficient
              to inhibit ETC and, consequently, aspartate synthesis in vivo.
              Therefore, aspartate may be a limiting metabolite for tumour
              growth, and aspartate availability could be targeted for cancer
              therapy.",

              Aspartate synthesis can limit cancer cell proliferation when
              respiration is impaired2-4; however, whether acquiring aspartate
              is endogenously limiting for tumour growth is unknown. We confirm
              that aspartate has poor cell permeability, which prevents
              environmental acquisition, whereas the related amino acid
              asparagine is available to cells in tumours, but cancer cells
              lack asparaginase activity to convert asparagine to aspartate.
              Heterologous expression of guinea pig asparaginase 1 (gpASNase1),
              an enzyme that produces aspartate from asparagine5, confers the

              generates any clinically relevant vulnerabilities in cancer
              cells. Here we mapped the aneuploidy landscapes of about 1,000
              human cancer cell lines, and analysed genetic and chemical
              perturbation screens2-9 to identify cellular vulnerabilities
              associated with aneuploidy. We found that aneuploid cancer cells
              show increased sensitivity to genetic perturbation of core
              components of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which
              ensures the proper segregation of chromosomes during mitosis10.
              Unexpectedly, we also found that aneuploid cancer cells were less
              sensitive than diploid cells to short-term exposure to multiple
              SAC inhibitors. Indeed, aneuploid cancer cells became
              increasingly sensitive to inhibition of SAC over time. Aneuploid
              cells exhibited aberrant spindle geometry and dynamics, and kept
              dividing when the SAC was inhibited, resulting in the
              accumulation of mitotic defects, and in unstable and less-fit
              karyotypes. Therefore, although aneuploid cancer cells could
              overcome inhibition of SAC more readily than diploid cells, their
              long-term proliferation was jeopardized. We identified a specific
              mitotic kinesin, KIF18A, whose activity was perturbed in
              aneuploid cancer cells. Aneuploid cancer cells were particularly
              vulnerable to depletion of KIF18A, and KIF18A overexpression
              restored their response to SAC inhibition. Our results identify a

              undergo WGD (WGD+ cells) must adapt to accommodate their abnormal

              whether they confer vulnerabilities that can be exploited
              therapeutically, is unclear. Here, using sequencing data from
              roughly 10,000 primary human cancer samples and essentiality data
              from approximately 600 cancer cell lines, we show that WGD gives

              clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4-5 driver mutations
              when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however,
              in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting
              that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis,
              in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single
              catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour
              evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede
              most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated
              genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance
              often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and

              tetraploidy. Using DNA combing and single-cell sequencing, we
              show that DNA replication dynamics is perturbed, generating
              under- and over-replicated regions. Mechanistically, we find that
              these defects result from a shortage of proteins during the G1/S
              transition, which impairs the fidelity of DNA replication. This
              work shows that within a single interphase, unscheduled
              tetraploid cells can acquire highly abnormal karyotypes. These
              findings provide an explanation for the genetic instability
              landscape that favours tumorigenesis after tetraploidization.",

              Deploying this framework to 9,873 cancers representing 33 human

              copy number signatures that explain the copy number patterns of
              97\% of samples. Seventeen copy number signatures were attributed
              to biological phenomena of whole-genome doubling, aneuploidy,

              drug-sensitive and resistant cells. Here, we present a
              theoretical study of intra-tumoral competition during adaptive
              therapy, to investigate under which circumstances it will be
              superior to aggressive treatment. METHODS: We develop and analyse
              a simple, 2-D, on-lattice, agent-based tumour model in which
              cells are classified as fully drug-sensitive or resistant.
              Subsequently, we compare this model to its corresponding
              non-spatial ordinary differential equation model, and fit it to
              longitudinal prostate-specific antigen data from 65 prostate
              cancer patients undergoing intermittent androgen deprivation
              therapy following biochemical recurrence. RESULTS: Leveraging the
              individual-based nature of our model, we explicitly demonstrate
              competitive suppression of resistance during adaptive therapy,
              and examine how different factors, such as the initial resistance
              fraction or resistance costs, alter competition. This not only
              corroborates our theoretical understanding of adaptive therapy,
              but also reveals that competition of resistant cells with each
              other may play a more important role in adaptive therapy in solid
              tumours than was previously thought. To conclude, we present two
              case studies, which demonstrate the implications of our work for:
              (i) mathematical modelling of adaptive therapy, and (ii) the
              intra-tumoral dynamics in prostate cancer patients during
              intermittent androgen deprivation treatment, a precursor of
              adaptive therapy. CONCLUSION: Our work shows that the tumour's
              spatial architecture is an important factor in adaptive therapy
              and provides insights into how adaptive therapy leverages both
              inter- and intra-specific competition to control resistance.",

              candidates for local therapy were eligible and randomly assigned
              to receive weekly intramuscular injections of ADI-PEG 20 at doses
              of 160 or 320 IU m(-2). The primary end point was disease-control

              The DCR and the median overall survival (OS) of the

              Noxa, Puma and BimEL, were activated and localized to
              mitochondrial sites within 24 h following drug exposure. However,
              caspase activity was low and death was unaffected by caspase
              inhibition. Transmission electron micrographs showed the presence
              of large vacuoles in drug-treated cells. An autophagic survival
              response has been attributed to MCF-7 cells following nutrient
              starvation or exposure to tamoxifen. Here, we show that autophagy

              Confocal microscopy revealed colocalization of mitochondria with

              would normally be inactivated by hyperphosphorylation. IFNgamma
              inhibits the kinase activities of cdk2, cdk4 and cdk6 within 24 h

              change within this time period, although cdk4 levels are

              protein levels, presumably by a post-transcriptional mechanism as
              no change was observed in the mRNA levels. In addition,
              IFNgamma-induced inhibition of cdk2 and cyclin E-associated
              kinase activities is accompanied by a 4.5-fold or greater
              increase of p27Kip1 in cdk2 complexes. p27 may also have a role
              in the inhibition of cdk4/6 kinase activities, as p27 protein
              associated with these complexes was increase by 55-70\% after

              engagement of its death receptors. TRAIL selectively induces
              apoptosis of a variety of tumor cells and transformed cells, but
              not most normal cells, and therefore has garnered intense
              interest as a promising agent for cancer therapy. TRAIL is

              surveillance and suppression of suppressing tumor metastasis.
              Some mismatch-repair-deficient tumors evade TRAIL-induced

              T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 to potentiate an antitumor
              T-cell response--administered with or without a glycoprotein 100
              (gp100) peptide vaccine was compared with gp100 alone in patients
              with previously treated metastatic melanoma. METHODS: A total of
              676 HLA-A*0201-positive patients with unresectable stage III or
              IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed while they were
              receiving therapy for metastatic disease, were randomly assigned,
              in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive ipilimumab plus gp100 (403
              patients), ipilimumab alone (137), or gp100 alone (136).
              Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, was
              administered with or without gp100 every 3 weeks for up to four
              treatments (induction). Eligible patients could receive
              reinduction therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.
              RESULTS: The median overall survival was 10.0 months among
              patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as compared with 6.4
              months among patients receiving gp100 alone (hazard ratio for
              death, 0.68; P<0.001). The median overall survival with
              ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio for death in the
              comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003). No difference in
              overall survival was detected between the ipilimumab groups
              (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100, 1.04; P=0.76). Grade 3
              or 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 to 15\% of
              patients treated with ipilimumab and in 3\% treated with gp100
              alone. There were 14 deaths related to the study drugs (2.1\%),
              and 7 were associated with immune-related adverse events.
              CONCLUSIONS: Ipilimumab, with or without a gp100 peptide vaccine,
              as compared with gp100 alone, improved overall survival in
              patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. Adverse
              events can be severe, long-lasting, or both, but most are
              reversible with appropriate treatment. (Funded by Medarex and

              3 study of ipilimumab (10 mg per kilogram) plus dacarbazine in
              patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma. METHODS:
              We randomly assigned 502 patients with previously untreated
              metastatic melanoma, in a 1:1 ratio, to ipilimumab (10 mg per
              kilogram) plus dacarbazine (850 mg per square meter of

              received ipilimumab or placebo every 12 weeks thereafter as
              maintenance therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.
              RESULTS: Overall survival was significantly longer in the group
              receiving ipilimumab plus dacarbazine than in the group receiving
              dacarbazine plus placebo (11.2 months vs. 9.1 months, with higher

              Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 56.3\% of patients
              treated with ipilimumab plus dacarbazine, as compared with 27.5\%

              The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy
              tisagenlecleucel targets and eliminates CD19-expressing B cells
              and showed efficacy against B-cell lymphomas in a single-center,
              phase 2a study. METHODS: We conducted an international, phase 2,
              pivotal study of centrally manufactured tisagenlecleucel
              involving adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse
              large B-cell lymphoma who were ineligible for or had disease
              progression after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell
              transplantation. The primary end point was the best overall
              response rate (i.e., the percentage of patients who had a
              complete or partial response), as judged by an independent review
              committee. RESULTS: A total of 93 patients received an infusion
              and were included in the evaluation of efficacy. The median time
              from infusion to data cutoff was 14 months (range, 0.1 to 26).
              The best overall response rate was 52\% (95\% confidence
              interval, 41 to 62); 40\% of the patients had complete responses,
              and 12\% had partial responses. Response rates were consistent
              across prognostic subgroups. At 12 months after the initial
              response, the rate of relapse-free survival was estimated to be
              65\% (79\% among patients with a complete response). The most
              common grade 3 or 4 adverse events of special interest included
              cytokine release syndrome (22\%), neurologic events (12\%),
              cytopenias lasting more than 28 days (32\%), infections (20\%),
              and febrile neutropenia (14\%). Three patients died from disease
              progression within 30 days after infusion. No deaths were
              attributed to tisagenlecleucel, cytokine release syndrome, or
              cerebral edema. No differences between response groups in tumor
              expression of CD19 or immune checkpoint-related proteins were

              follow-up of 60 months, the median overall survival was more than
              60.0 months (median not reached) in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab
              group and 36.9 months in the nivolumab group, as compared with
              19.9 months in the ipilimumab group (hazard ratio for death with
              nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.52; hazard ratio for
              death with nivolumab vs. ipilimumab, 0.63). Overall survival at 5
              years was 52\% in the nivolumab-plus-ipilimumab group and 44\% in
              the nivolumab group, as compared with 26\% in the ipilimumab
              group. No sustained deterioration of health-related quality of
              life was observed during or after treatment with nivolumab plus
              ipilimumab or with nivolumab alone. No new late toxic effects
              were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced melanoma,
              sustained long-term overall survival at 5 years was observed in a
              greater percentage of patients who received nivolumab plus
              ipilimumab or nivolumab alone than in those who received
              ipilimumab alone, with no apparent loss of quality of life in the
              patients who received regimens containing nivolumab. (Funded by

              Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 39, 545-565]. A substantial fraction of
              this energy budget is devoted to biosynthesis of amino acids, the
              building blocks of proteins. The fueling reactions of central
              metabolism provide precursor metabolites for synthesis of the 20
              amino acids incorporated into proteins. Thus, synthesis of an
              amino acid entails a dual cost: energy is lost by diverting
              chemical intermediates from fueling reactions and additional
              energy is required to convert precursor metabolites to amino
              acids. Among amino acids, costs of synthesis vary from 12 to 74

              spectroscopy to examine the metabolism of glioblastoma cells
              exhibiting aerobic glycolysis. In these cells, the tricarboxylic
              acid (TCA) cycle was active but was characterized by an efflux of
              substrates for use in biosynthetic pathways, particularly fatty
              acid synthesis. The success of this synthetic activity depends on
              activation of pathways to generate reductive power (NADPH) and to
              restore oxaloacetate for continued TCA cycle function
              (anaplerosis). Surprisingly, both these needs were met by a high
              rate of glutamine metabolism. First, conversion of glutamine to
              lactate (glutaminolysis) was rapid enough to produce sufficient
              NADPH to support fatty acid synthesis. Second, despite
              substantial mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism, pyruvate
              carboxylation was suppressed, and anaplerotic oxaloacetate was
              derived from glutamine. Glutamine catabolism was accompanied by
              secretion of alanine and ammonia, such that most of the amino
              groups from glutamine were lost from the cell rather than

              nucleotide synthesis or maintenance of nonessential amino acid
              pools. Rather, glutamine metabolism provides a carbon source that
              facilitates the cell's ability to use glucose-derived carbon and

              interleukin-2 (IL-2) is essential for the homeostasis of
              regulatory T (Treg) cells that suppress (auto)immunity and
              stimulates immune responses mediated by conventional T cells. We
              combined mathematical modeling and experiments to dissect the
              dynamics of the IL-2 signaling network that links the
              prototypical IL-2 producers, conventional T helper (Th) cells,
              and Treg cells. We show how the IL-2-induced upregulation of
              high-affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) establishes a positive
              feedback loop of IL-2 signaling. This feedback mediates a digital
              switch for the proliferation of Th cells and functions as an
              analog amplifier for the IL-2 uptake capacity of Treg cells.
              Unlike other positive feedbacks in cell signaling that augment
              signal propagation, the IL-2/IL-2R loop enhances the capture of
              the signal molecule and its degradation. Thus Treg and Th cells
              can compete for IL-2 and restrict its range of action through
              efficient cellular uptake. Depending on activation status and
              spatial localization of the cells, IL-2 may be consumed
              exclusively by Treg or Th cells, or be shared between them. In
              particular, a Treg cell can deprive a stimulated Th cell of its
              IL-2, but only when the cells are located in close proximity,
              within a few tens of micrometers. The present findings explain
              how IL-2 can play two distinct roles in immune regulation and
              point to a hitherto largely unexplored spatiotemporal complexity

              selective advantage. This dual nature of aneuploidy raises the

              we show that chromosomal duplications are first acquired as a
              crude solution to stress, yet only as transient solutions that
              are eliminated and replaced by more efficient solutions obtained

              than abruptly, alternative solutions appear to have emerged, but
              not aneuploidy. Our findings indicate that chromosomal
              duplication is a first evolutionary line of defense, that retains

              merely serves as a ``quick fix,'' whereas more refined and

              possible genotypes is astronomical. One approach is to sample as
              many genotypes as possible, measure their fitnesses, and fit a
              statistical model of the landscape that includes additive and
              pairwise interactive effects between loci. Here, we elucidate the
              pitfalls of using such regressions by studying artificial but
              mathematically convenient fitness landscapes. We identify two
              sources of bias inherent in these regression procedures, each of
              which tends to underestimate high fitnesses and overestimate low

              interest as they could be exploited to generate a more
              efficacious antitumor immunity. As such, stimulator of IFN genes
              (STING), an adaptor molecule involved in cytosolic DNA sensing,
              is required for the induction of antitumor CD8 T responses in
              mouse models of cancer. Here, we find that enforced activation of
              STING by intratumoral injection of cyclic dinucleotide GMP-AMP
              (cGAMP), potently enhanced antitumor CD8 T responses leading to
              growth control of injected and contralateral tumors in mouse
              models of melanoma and colon cancer. The ability of cGAMP to
              trigger antitumor immunity was further enhanced by the blockade
              of both PD1 and CTLA4. The STING-dependent antitumor immunity,

              intratumoral cGAMP injection was dependent on type I IFNs

              mechanisms responsible for lineage-specific expansions of genome
              size in eukaryotes, especially in multicellular species. One idea
              is that all excess DNA is mutationally hazardous, but weakly
              enough so that genome-size expansion passively emerges in species
              experiencing relatively low efficiency of selection owing to
              small effective population sizes. Another idea is that
              substantial gene additions were impossible without the energetic
              boost provided by the colonizing mitochondrion in the eukaryotic
              lineage. Contrary to this latter view, analysis of cellular
              energetics and genomics data from a wide variety of species
              indicates that, relative to the lifetime ATP requirements of a
              cell, the costs of a gene at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels
              decline with cell volume in both bacteria and eukaryotes.
              Moreover, these costs are usually sufficiently large to be
              perceived by natural selection in bacterial populations, but not
              in eukaryotes experiencing high levels of random genetic drift.
              Thus, for scaling reasons that are not yet understood, by virtue
              of their large size alone, eukaryotic cells are subject to a

              Because a single CTL can kill multiple targets, degranulation
              must be tightly regulated. However, how CTLs regulate the
              termination of granule secretion remains unclear. Previous work
              demonstrated that centralized actin reduction at the immune
              synapse precedes degranulation. Using a combination of live
              confocal, total internal reflection fluorescence, and
              superresolution microscopy, we now show that, after granule
              fusion, actin recovers at the synapse and no further secretion is
              observed. Depolymerization of actin led to resumed granule
              secretion, suggesting that recovered actin acts as a barrier
              preventing sustained degranulation. Furthermore, RAB27a-deficient
              CTLs, which do not secrete cytotoxic granules, failed to recover
              actin at the synapse, suggesting that RAB27a-mediated granule

              both actin clearance and recovery correlated with synaptic

              spontaneously arising tumors in mice. Compared with wild-type
              mice, mice lacking sensitivity to either IFN-gamma (i.e.,
              IFN-gamma receptor-deficient mice) or all IFN family members
              (i.e., Stat1-deficient mice) developed tumors more rapidly and
              with greater frequency when challenged with different doses of
              the chemical carcinogen methylcholanthrene. In addition,
              IFN-gamma-insensitive mice developed tumors more rapidly than
              wild-type mice when bred onto a background deficient in the p53
              tumor-suppressor gene. IFN-gamma-insensitive p53(-/-) mice also
              developed a broader spectrum of tumors compared with mice lacking
              p53 alone. Using tumor cells derived from
              methylcholanthrene-treated IFN-gamma-insensitive mice, we found
              IFN-gamma's actions to be mediated at least partly through its

              immunogenicity. The importance and generality of this system is
              evidenced by the finding that certain types of human tumors

              generation by each pathway can be calculated from simultaneous
              measurements of extracellular acidification and oxygen
              consumption. We update theoretical maximum ATP yields by
              mitochondria and cells catabolizing different substrates.
              Mitochondrial P/O ratios (mol of ATP generated per mol of [O]
              consumed) are 2.73 for oxidation of pyruvate plus malate and 1.64
              for oxidation of succinate. Complete oxidation of glucose by
              cells yields up to 33.45 ATP/glucose with a maximum P/O of 2.79.
              We introduce novel indices to quantify bioenergetic phenotypes.
              The glycolytic index reports the proportion of ATP production
              from glycolysis and identifies cells as primarily glycolytic
              (glycolytic index > 50\%) or primarily oxidative. The Warburg
              effect is a chronic increase in glycolytic index, quantified by
              the Warburg index. Additional indices quantify the acute
              flexibility of ATP supply. The Crabtree index and Pasteur index
              quantify the responses of oxidative and glycolytic ATP production
              to alterations in glycolysis and oxidative reactions,
              respectively; the supply flexibility index quantifies overall
              flexibility of ATP supply; and the bioenergetic capacity
              quantifies the maximum rate of total ATP production. We
              illustrate the determination of these indices using C2C12
              myoblasts. Measurement of ATP use revealed no significant
              preference for glycolytic or oxidative ATP by specific ATP
              consumers. Overall, we demonstrate how extracellular fluxes
              quantitatively reflect intracellular ATP turnover and cellular
              bioenergetics. We provide a simple spreadsheet to calculate

              cycle arrest in interphase, rather than causing mitotic defects.
              In addition, data mining of cancer patient database showed a

              Tumor-infiltrating CTLs produce IFN$\gamma$ and mediate antitumor
              activity, but they simultaneously induce counter-regulatory
              immunosuppressive mechanisms in the tumor by recruiting monocytic
              myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that limit their
              proliferation and effector function. Using a murine model of
              adoptive immunotherapy for B16 melanoma, we developed a strategy
              to augment CTL activity by downregulating immunosuppression by
              MDSCs. Intravenous injection of transgenic pmel-1 CTLs into
              tumor-bearing mice, resulted in their infiltration into the
              tumor, but this was accompanied by the accumulation of large
              numbers of monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs). These cells hampered CTL
              function and reduced their numbers in the tumor. We determined
              that one mechanism responsible for this immunosuppression was the
              production of nitric oxide (NO) by MDSCs in the tumor. Therefore,
              mice were given the NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO (C-PTIO) on the day
              after CTL transfer. This led to the restoration of impaired
              proliferative capacity and function of the CTLs, resulting in
              sustained suppression of tumor growth. Thus, we conclude that CTL
              therapy can be improved by counter-acting immunosuppression.
              Targeting NO, one mediator of the immunosuppressive activity of
              M-MDSCs, may be an appropriate strategy to restore impaired CTL

               programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1. We propose a

              lysosomal marker proteins was determined in human and murine CTL,
              by immunogold labeling of ultrathin cryosections followed by
              electron microscopy. Perforin and granzymes can be detected in
              rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi complex, trans-Golgi

              Perforin-dependent cytotoxicity is a major effector function of
              CD8+ MHC class I-restricted T cells and of NK cells. Here, we

              different syngeneic tumor cell lines of different tissue origin
              in naive and primed mice; (b) administration of the chemical
              carcinogens methylcholanthrene (MCA) or
              12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) plus

              analyzes the defense against a tumor load given at once, whereas
              the last two sets give information on immune defense against
              tumors at the very moment of their generation. Most of the tumor
              cell lines tested were eliminated 10-100-fold better by C57BL/6
              mice in an unprimed situation; after priming, the differences
              were more pronounced. Lymphoma cells transfected with Fas were
              controlled 10-fold better by PKO and C57BL/6 mice when compared
              to untransfected control cells, indicating some role for FasL in
              tumor control. MCA-induced tumors arose more rapidly and with a
              higher incidence in PKO mice compared to C57BL/6 or CD8-deficient
              mice. DMBA+TPA-induced skin papillomas arose with similar high
              incidence and comparable kinetics in both mouse strains. C57BL/6
              and PKO mice have a similar incidence of Moloney murine sarcoma
              and leukemia virus-induced sarcomas, but tumors are larger and
              regression is retarded in PKO mice. Thus, perforin-dependent

              lymphocyte- and NK-dependent resistance to injected tumor cell
              lines, but also operates during viral and chemical carcinogenesis

              cytotoxicity by studying resistance to tumor cell lines that were
              stably transfected with Fas neither provided evidence for a major

              4-1BB and the T cell receptor (TCR) on activated T cells has been
              shown to deliver a costimulatory signal to T cells. Here, we
              expand upon previously published studies by demonstrating that
              CD8+ T cells when compared with CD4+ T cells are preferentially
              responsive to both early activation events and proliferative
              signals provided via the TCR and 4-1BB. In comparison,
              CD28-mediated costimulatory signals appear to function in a

              In vivo examination of the effects of anti-4-1BB monoclonal

              crucial role in the development of immune responses. Two-photon

              Here, we construct a spatially explicit model of T cell and DC
              migration in LNs and show that all dynamical properties of T
              cells could be a consequence of the densely packed LN

              cells in G1 following inappropriate exit from mitosis in the
              presence of microtubule inhibitors. We have here addressed the
              question of whether the resulting tetraploid state itself, rather
              than failure of spindle function or induction of spindle damage,
              acts as a checkpoint to arrest cells in G1. Dihydrocytochalasin B
              induces cleavage failure in cells where spindle function and
              chromatid segregation are both normal. Notably, we show here that
              nontransformed REF-52 cells arrest indefinitely in tetraploid G1
              following cleavage failure. The spindle assembly checkpoint and
              the tetraploidization checkpoint that we describe here are likely
              to be equivalent. Both involve arrest in G1 with inactive cdk2
              kinase, hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, and elevated
              levels of p21(WAF1) and cyclin E. Furthermore, both require p53.
              We show that failure to arrest in G1 following tetraploidization
              rapidly results in aneuploidy. Similar tetraploid G1 arrest
              results have been obtained with mouse NIH3T3 and human IMR-90
              cells. Thus, we propose that a general checkpoint control acts in
              G1 to recognize tetraploid cells and induce their arrest and
              thereby prevents the propagation of errors of late mitosis and
              the generation of aneuploidy. As such, the tetraploidy checkpoint
              may be a critical activity of p53 in its role of ensuring genomic
              integrity.",

               PD-L1 expression and improved pembro antitumor activity has been
               observed.Methods: 282 pts with treatment-naive or previously
               treated advanced NSCLC enrolled in randomized and nonrandomized
               cohorts of the phase 1 KEYNOTE-001 study were analyzed. To
               inform enrollment, tumor PD-L1 expression was determined
               prospectively by a prototype IHC assay (PA) in all pts. Samples
               were independently reanalyzed using a clinical trial IHC assay
               (CTA). Pembro was given at 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W), 10 mg/kg
               Q3W, or 10 mg/kg Q2W until progression, death, or unacceptable
               toxicity. Overall response rate (ORR) was assessed per RECIST
               v1.1 by central review and per immune-related response criteria
               (irRC) by investigator review.Results: Mature data are available
               for 262 pts (5.4-mo median follow-up). Grade 3--5 drug-related
               AEs occurred in 24 (9\%) pts, most commonly pneumonitis (n = 5
               [n = 3 grade 3, n = 2 grade 4]). ORR (RECIST/irRC) in pts with
               measurable disease at baseline was 21\%/23\% overall (26\%/47\%
               treatment naive, 20\%/18\% previously treated) and was similar
               in pts with squamous (18\%/25\%) and nonsquamous (23\%/23\%)
               histology. ORR was 33\%/67\% at 2 mg/kg Q3W (n = 6), 21\%/22\%
               at 10 mg/kg Q3W (n = 141), and 21\%/22\% at 10 mg/kg Q2W (n =
               115). As assessed by the PA, ORR was 23\%/25\% in pts with
               $\geq$1\% PD-L1 staining and 9\%/13\% in pts with no PD-L1
               staining. Preliminary median PFS will be presented, as will data
               for an additional 20 previously treated pts who received pembro
               2 mg/kg Q3W. To date, data for PD-L1 staining using the CTA are
               available for nearly one-half of pts. In these pts, ORR
               (RECIST/irRC) was 39\%/47\% in pts with strong PD-L1 expression
               ($\geq$50\% staining) and 16\%/9\% in pts with weak/negative
               PD-L1 expression.Conclusions: Pembro is tolerable and provides
               antitumor activity in treatment-naive or previously treated
               advanced NSCLC, regardless of dose/schedule. Pts with strong
               PD-L1 tumor expression may derive particular benefit from
               pembro.Disclosure: E.B. Garon: Corporate-sponsored research:

              metabolic enzymes, converting isocitrate to
              $\alpha$-ketoglutarate ($\alpha$KG).IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have
              been identified in multiple tumor types, including gliomas and
              myeloid malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
              myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Here we provide an overview of
              the function of normal and mutated IDH, discuss the role of IDH
              mutations in tumorigenesis and progression and review the key
              clinical considerations when treating IDH-mutated tumors based on
              emerging clinical data from mutant IDH1/2 inhibitor trials. IDH1
              and IDH2 mutations confer neomorphic activity in the mutant
              protein, resulting in the conversion of $\alpha$KG to the
              oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). The subsequent
              accumulation of 2-HG results in epigenetic dysregulation via
              inhibition of $\alpha$KG-dependent histone and DNA demethylases,
              and a block in cellular differentiation. There is growing
              preclinical and clinical evidence suggesting that IDHmutations
              are involved in neoplasia. Furthermore, preclinical studies
              assessing small molecule inhibitors of mutant IDH1/2 enzymes have
              provided proof of concept that this approach decreases
              intracellular 2-HG levels, reverses epigenetic dysregulation and
              induces cellular differentiation. Phase I studies of mutant IDH
              inhibitors are currently ongoing in patients with IDH-mutant
              hematologic and solid tumors, with early data in hematologic
              tumors suggesting a manageable safety profile as well as clinical
              benefit, with a mechanism of action based on differentiation of
              malignant cells. Inhibition of mutant IDH shows promise as a
              treatment approach in hematologic malignancies, with further
              development ongoing in solid tumors and glioma. The mutant IDH
              inhibitors may have clinical utility both as single agents and in
              combination strategies that target additional oncogenic pathways.",

              analysis of all the current IO agents in clinical development and
              the clinical trials testing these agents. We based our analyses

              target enrollment of 577 076 patients. This report provides key
              analyses of these data. Furthermore, we will discuss a number of

              for analyzing this so-called identifiability of model parameters.
              However, they are typically computationally demanding, difficult
              to perform and/or not applicable in many application settings.
              Results: Here, an approach is presented which enables quickly
              testing of parameter identifiability. Numerical optimization with
              a penalty in radial direction enforcing displacement of the
              parameters is used to check whether estimated parameters are
              unique, or whether the parameters can be altered without loss of
              agreement with the data indicating non-identifiability. This
              Identifiability-Test by Radial Penalization (ITRP) can be
              employed for every model where optimization-based parameter
              estimation like least-squares or maximum likelihood is feasible
              and is therefore applicable for all typical systems biology
              models. The approach is illustrated and tested using 11 ordinary
              differential equation (ODE) models. Availability and
              implementation: The presented approach can be implemented without
              great efforts in any modelling framework. It is available within
              the free Matlab-based modelling toolbox Data2Dynamics. Source

              differential equations with unknown parameters. The unknown
              parameters are usually estimated from experimental data. In some
              cases, due to the structure of the model, this estimation problem
              does not have a unique solution even in the case of continuous
              noise-free data. It is therefore desirable to check the
              uniqueness a priori before carrying out actual experiments. We

  abstract = "In this paper a mathematical model describing the growth of a
              solid tumour in the presence of an immune system response is
              presented. In particular, attention is focused upon the attack of
              tumour cells by so-called tumour-infiltrating cytotoxic
              lymphocytes (TICLs), in a small, multicellular tumour, without
              necrosis and at some stage prior to (tumour-induced)
              angiogenesis. At this stage the immune cells and the tumour cells
              are considered to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium--cancer
              dormancy--a phenomenon which has been observed in primary
              tumours, micrometastases and residual disease after ablation of
              the primary tumour. Nonetheless, the precise biochemical and
              cellular mechanisms by which TICLs control cancer dormancy are
              still poorly understood from a biological and immunological point
              of view. Therefore we focus on the analysis of the
              spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour cells, immune cells and
              chemokines in an immunogenic tumour. The lymphocytes are assumed
              to migrate into the growing solid tumour and interact with the
              tumour cells in such a way that lymphocyte-tumour cell complexes
              are formed. These complexes result in either the death of the
              tumour cells (the normal situation) or the inactivation
              (sometimes even the death) of the lymphocytes. The migration of
              the TICLs is determined by a combination of random motility and
              chemotaxis in response to the presence of chemokines. The
              resulting system of four nonlinear partial differential equations
              (TICLs, tumour cells, complexes and chemokines) is analysed and
              numerical simulations are presented. We consider two different
              tumour geometries--multi-layered cell growth and multi-cellular
              spheroid growth. The numerical simulations demonstrate the
              existence of cell distributions that are quasi-stationary in time
              and heterogeneous in space. A linear stability analysis of the
              underlying (spatially homogeneous) ordinary differential equation
              (ODE) kinetics coupled with a numerical investigation of the ODE
              system reveals the existence of a stable limit cycle. This is
              verified further when a subsequent bifurcation analysis is
              undertaken using a numerical continuation package. These results
              then explain the complex heterogeneous spatio-temporal dynamics
              observed in the partial differential equation (PDE) system. Our
              approach may lead to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of
              cancer dormancy and may be helpful in the future development of
              more effective anti-cancer vaccines.",

               respectively. Single‐cell PCR showed that expression frequencies

               largely based on its cytocidal power combined with the ability
               to selectively target tumors. Radiotherapy effects on survival
               of cancer patients are generally interpreted as the consequence
               of improved local control of the tumor, directly decreasing
               systemic spread. Experimental data from multiple cancer models
               have provided sufficient evidence to propose a paradigm shift,
               whereby some of the effects of ionizing radiation are recognized
               as contributing to systemic antitumor immunity. Recent examples
               of objective responses achieved by adding radiotherapy to
               immunotherapy in metastatic cancer patients support this view.
               Therefore, the traditional palliative role of radiotherapy in
               metastatic disease is evolving into that of a powerful adjuvant
               for immunotherapy. This combination strategy adds to the current
               anticancer arsenal and offers opportunities to harness the

               knowledge must include potential immunosuppressive effects of

              have so far only offered limited insight into real-world

              impossible to exhaustively measure the fitness of all variants of

              protein synthesis at different stages of the cell cycle, during
              which these events are regulated at multiple levels. Therefore
              the synthesis of the precursor nucleotides is also strongly
              regulated at multiple levels. Nucleotide synthesis is an energy
              intensive process that uses multiple metabolic pathways across

              After 3 h of incubation with apoptotic cells, phagocytes tested
              were washed to remove nonengulfed cells, then fixed, stained, and
              counted to determine phagocytosis index (PI). NHA, glioma cells,

              astrocytoma that is distinguished pathologically from lower grade
              tumors by necrosis and microvascular hyperplasia. Necrotic foci
              are typically surrounded by ``pseudopalisading'' cells-a
              configuration that is relatively unique to malignant gliomas and
              has long been recognized as an ominous prognostic feature.
              Precise mechanisms that relate morphology to biologic behavior
              have not been described. Recent investigations have demonstrated
              that pseudopalisades are severely hypoxic, overexpress
              hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), and secrete proangiogenic
              factors such as VEGF and IL-8. Thus, the microvascular
              hyperplasia in GBM that provides a new vasculature and promotes
              peripheral tumor expansion is tightly linked with the emergence
              of pseudopalisades. Both pathologic observations and experimental
              evidence have indicated that the development of hypoxia and
              necrosis within astrocytomas could arise secondary to
              vaso-occlusion and intravascular thrombosis. This emerging model
              suggests that pseudopalisades represent a wave of tumor cells
              actively migrating away from central hypoxia that arises after a
              vascular insult. Experimental glioma models have shown that
              endothelial apoptosis, perhaps resulting from angiopoetin-2,
              initiates vascular pathology, whereas observations in human
              tumors have clearly demonstrated that intravascular thrombosis
              develops with high frequency in the transition to GBM. Tissue
              factor, the main cellular initiator of thrombosis, is
              dramatically upregulated in response to PTEN loss and hypoxia in
              human GBM and could promote a prothrombotic environment that
              precipitates these events. A prothrombotic environment also
              activates the family of protease activated receptors (PARs) on
              tumor cells, which are G-protein-coupled and enhance invasive and
              proangiogenic properties. Vaso-occlusive and prothrombotic
              mechanisms in GBM could readily explain the presence of
              pseudopalisading necrosis in tissue sections, the rapid
              peripheral expansion on neuroimaging, and the dramatic shift to
              an accelerated rate of clinical progression resulting from

              was recently reported to reflect functional exhaustion, resulting
              in uncontrolled HIV-1 replication. Assessing PD-1 expression on T
              cells may be highly relevant in T-cell immunology and vaccine
              monitoring. However, this requires us to gain further insights
              into the significance of PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells in
              humans. METHODS: We performed a detailed analysis of PD-1
              expression pattern on various CD8 T cell subsets from healthy or
              HIV infected donors. RESULTS: PD-1 expression has two facets in
              vivo. On the one hand, it is linked to T-cell differentiation:
              PD-1 is up-regulated on early/intermediate differentiated
              subsets, which include HIV and Epstein-Barr virus-specific CD8
              T-cell populations, but is down-regulated during late stages of
              differentiation. On the other hand, it is linked to T-cell
              activation: on PD-1 positive cells, PD-1 over-expression occurs
              along with the up-regulation of activation markers such as CD38
              or HLA-DR. CONCLUSIONS: PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells, including
              those specific for HIV, can be related both to their
              differentiation stage and their activation status. It is
              important to consider these findings when assessing the

  abstract = "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and antibiotics reduce the net
              growth rate of bacterial populations they target. It is relevant
              to understand if effects of multiple antimicrobials are
              synergistic or antagonistic, in particular for AMP responses,
              because naturally occurring responses involve multiple AMPs.
              There are several competing proposals describing how multiple
              types of antimicrobials add up when applied in combination, such
              as Loewe additivity or Bliss independence. These additivity terms
              are defined ad hoc from abstract principles explaining the
              supposed interaction between the antimicrobials. Here, we link
              these ad hoc combination terms to a mathematical model that
              represents the dynamics of antimicrobial molecules hitting
              targets on bacterial cells. In this multi-hit model, bacteria are
              killed when a certain number of targets are hit by
              antimicrobials. Using this bottom-up approach reveals that Bliss
              independence should be the model of choice if no interaction
              between antimicrobial molecules is expected. Loewe additivity, on
              the other hand, describes scenarios in which antimicrobials
              affect the same components of the cell, i.e. are not acting
              independently. While our approach idealizes the dynamics of
              antimicrobials, it provides a conceptual underpinning of the
              additivity terms. The choice of the additivity term is essential
              to determine synergy or antagonism of antimicrobials.This article

              are under development. Two prominent strategies are adoptive cell
              transfer (ACT) of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and modulation
              of CTL function with immune checkpoint inhibitors or with
              costimulatory antibodies. Despite some success with these
              approaches, there remains a lack of detailed and quantitative
              descriptions of the events following CTL transfer and the impact
              of immunomodulation. Here, we have applied ordinary differential
              equation models to two photon imaging data derived from a B16F10
              murine melanoma. Models were parameterised with data from two
              different treatment conditions: either ACT-only, or ACT with
              intratumoural costimulation using a CD137 targeted antibody.
              Model dynamics and best fitting parameters were compared, in
              order to assess the mode of action of the CTLs and examine how
              the CD137 antibody influenced their activities. We found that the
              cytolytic activity of the transferred CTLs was minimal without
              CD137 costimulation, and that the CD137 targeted antibody did not
              enhance the per-capita killing ability of the transferred CTLs.
              Instead, the results of our modelling study suggest that an
              antiproliferative effect of CTLs exerted upon the tumour likely
              accounted for the majority of the reduction in tumour growth
              after CTL transfer. We found that CD137 most likely improved
              tumour control via enhancement of this antiproliferative effect,
              as well as prolonging the period in which CTLs were inside the
              tumour, leading to a sustained duration of their antitumour
              effects following CD137 stimulation. Significance CTLs play an
              important role in controlling tumours, and improved understanding
              of how they accomplish this will benefit immunotherapeutic cancer
              treatment strategies. Stimulation of CTLs by targeting their
              CD137 receptor is a strategy currently under investigation for
              enhancing responses against tumours, yet so far only limited
              quantitative knowledge regarding the effects of such stimulation
              upon CTLs has been obtained. Here, we develop mathematical models
              to describe dynamic in vivo two-photon imaging of tumour

              either in the presence or absence of a CD137 agonist antibody. We

              sustained presence of CTLs within the tumour were the most

              are gained or lost-causes reduced fitness at both the cellular
              and organismal levels but is also a hallmark of human cancers.
              Aneuploidy causes a variety of cellular stresses, including
              genomic instability, proteotoxic and oxidative stresses, and
              impaired protein trafficking. The deubiquitinase Ubp3, which was
              identified by a genome-wide screen for gene deletions that impair
              the fitness of aneuploid yeast, is a key regulator of aneuploid
              cell homeostasis. We show that deletion of UBP3 exacerbates both
              karyotype-specific phenotypes and global stresses of aneuploid
              cells, including oxidative and proteotoxic stress. Indeed, Ubp3
              is essential for proper proteasome function in euploid cells, and
              deletion of this deubiquitinase leads to further
              proteasome-mediated proteotoxicity in aneuploid yeast. Notably,
              the importance of UBP3 in aneuploid cells is conserved. Depletion
              of the human homolog of UBP3, USP10, is detrimental to the
              fitness of human cells upon chromosome missegregation, and this
              fitness defect is accompanied by autophagy inhibition. We thus
              used a genome-wide screen in yeast to identify a guardian of
              aneuploid cell fitness conserved across species. We propose that
              interfering with Ubp3/USP10 function could be a productive avenue

              comparison of existing chromosomal instability (CIN) mouse models
              suggests that aneuploidy accumulates to low levels in these
              animals. We therefore developed a novel mouse model that enables
              unprecedented levels of chromosome missegregation in the adult
              animal. At the earliest stages of T-cell development, cells with
              random chromosome gains and/or losses are selected against, but
              CIN eventually results in the expansion of progenitors with
              clonal chromosomal imbalances. Clonal selection leads to the
              development of T-cell lymphomas with stereotypic karyotypes in
              which chromosome 15, containing the Myc oncogene, is gained with

              enable the measurement of decay rates simultaneously for

              functional classes at various levels of resolution and compare
              the decay rate statistics between these classes. The results show
              statistically significant organizational principles in the
              variation of decay rates among functional classes. In particular,
              transcription factor mRNAs have increased average decay rates

              and enhanced cytosine methylation. The increased cell size offers
              a positive advantage to polyploids for cell-surface-related
              activities, but there is a differential response to change in
              body size across species and taxonomic groups. Although
              polyploidy has been very extensively studied, having genetic,
              ecological and evolutionary implications, there is no report that
              underscores the significance of native secondary metabolites
              vis-{\`a}-vis body size with ploidy change. To address this
              problem we targeted unique diploid-autotetraploid paired sets of
              eight diverse clones of six species of Cymbopogon- a species
              complex of aromatic grasses that accumulate qualitatively
              different monoterpene essential oils (secondary metabolite) in
              their vegetative biomass. Based on the qualitative composition of
              essential oils and the plant body size relationship between the
              diploid versus autotetraploid paired sets, we show that
              polyploidy brings about enhanced accumulation of secondary
              metabolites in all cases, but exerts differential effects on body
              size in various species. It is observed that the accumulation of
              alcohol-type metabolites (e.g. geraniol) does not inhibit
              increase in body size with ploidy change from 2$\times$ to
              4$\times$ (r = 0.854, P < 0.01), but aldehyde-type metabolites
              (e.g. citral) appear to drastically impede body development (r =
              -0.895). Such a differential response may be correlated to the
              metabolic steps involved in the synthesis of essential oil
              components. When changed to tetraploidy, the progenitor diploids
              requiring longer metabolic steps in production of their secondary
              metabolites are stressed, and those having shorter metabolite
              routes better utilize their resources for growth and vigour. In
              situ immunodetection of 5-methylcytosine sites reveals enhanced
              DNA methylation in autopolyploids. It is underpinned that the
              qualitative composition of secondary metabolites found in the
              vegetative biomass of the progenitor diploid has a decisive
              bearing on the body size of the derived autotetraploids and
              brings about an enhancement in genome-wide cytosine methylation.",

               indicators, such as Moran's I, into the contribution of each

               be used to assess the influence of individual locations on the
               magnitude of the global statistic and to identify ?outliers,? as
               in Anselin's Moran scatterplot (1993a). An initial evaluation of

              CD8(+) T cells as well as on a number of other lymphoid and
              non-lymphoid cells. Costimulatory signals from OX40 to a

              clonal expansion of effector and memory populations as they are
              being generated to antigen. OX40 additionally suppresses the
              differentiation and activity of T-regulatory cells, further
              amplifying this process. OX40 and OX40L also regulate cytokine
              production from T cells, antigen-presenting cells, natural killer
              cells, and natural killer T cells, and modulate cytokine receptor
              signaling. In line with these important modulatory functions,
              OX40-OX40L interactions have been found to play a central role in
              the development of multiple inflammatory and autoimmune diseases,

              Depletion of tissue macrophages interfered with SMG TRM motility

              receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancers growing orthotopically
              in a mouse mammary fat pad with paclitaxel, using algorithms
              linked to tumor response monitored by magnetic resonance imaging.
              We found that initial control required more intensive therapy
              with regular application of drug to deflect the exponential tumor
              growth curve onto a plateau. Dose-skipping algorithms during this
              phase were less successful than variable dosing algorithms.
              However, once initial tumor control was achieved, it was
              maintained with progressively smaller drug doses. In 60 to 80\%
              of animals, continued decline in tumor size permitted intervals
              as long as several weeks in which no treatment was necessary.
              Magnetic resonance images and histological analysis of tumors
              controlled by adaptive therapy demonstrated increased vascular
              density and less necrosis, suggesting that vascular normalization
              resulting from enforced stabilization of tumor volume may
              contribute to ongoing tumor control with lower drug doses. Our
              study demonstrates that an evolution-based therapeutic strategy
              using an available chemotherapeutic drug and conventional
              clinical imaging can prolong the progression-free survival in

              paclitaxel to induce mitotic arrest in tumor cells. Instead,
              clinically relevant concentrations induced multipolar mitotic
              spindle formation. However, the extent of early multipolarity did
              not predict patient response. Whereas multipolar divisions
              frequently led to cell death, multipolar spindles focused into
              bipolar spindles before division at variable frequency, and
              maintaining multipolarity throughout mitosis was critical to
              induce the high rates of chromosomal instability necessary for
              paclitaxel to elicit cell death. Increasing multipolar divisions
              in paclitaxel resulted in improved cytotoxicity. Conversely,
              decreasing paclitaxel-induced multipolar divisions reduced
              paclitaxel efficacy. Moreover, we found that preexisting

              known for any viral infection. We propose a framework to quantify
              T-cell-mediated killing of infected or peptide-pulsed target
              cells using the widely used in vivo cytotoxicity assay. We have
              reanalyzed recently published data on killing of peptide-pulsed

              specific to NP396 and GP276 epitopes of lymphocytic

              are so many effector CD8 T cells in spleens of mice at the peak
              of the immune response, NP396- and GP276-pulsed targets are

              in LCMV-immune mice, the half-lives become 48 min and 2.8 h for
              NP396- and GP276-expressing targets, respectively. Analysis of

              there has been surprisingly little information on the
              bioenergetics of growth. For many years, it was assumed that
              biomass production (anabolism) was proportional to the amount of
              ATP which could be derived from energy-yielding pathways
              (catabolism), but later work showed that the ATP yield (YATP) was
              not necessarily a constant. Continuous-culture experiments
              indicated that bacteria utilized ATP for metabolic reactions that
              were not directly related to growth (maintenance functions).
              Mathematical derivations showed that maintenance energy appeared
              to be a growth rate-independent function of the cell mass and
              time. Later work, however, showed that maintenance energy alone
              could not account for all the variations in yield. Because only
              some of the discrepancy could be explained by the secretion of
              metabolites (overflow metabolism) or the diversion of catabolism
              to metabolic pathways which produced less ATP, it appeared that
              energy-excess cultures had mechanisms of spilling energy.
              Bacteria have the potential to spill excess ATP in futile enzyme
              cycles, but there has been little proof that such cycles are
              significant. Recent work indicated that bacteria can also use
              futile cycles of potassium, ammonia, and protons through the cell
              membrane to dissipate ATP either directly or indirectly. The
              utility of energy spilling in bacteria has been a curiosity. The
              deprivation of energy from potential competitors is at best a
              teleological explanation that cannot be easily supported by
              standard theories of natural selection. The priming of
              intracellular intermediates for future growth or protection of

              instability (MSI) resulting from defective DNA mismatch repair
              confers a better prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC). Recently,
              however, data have suggested this is secondary to the effects of
              ploidy/chromosomal instability (CIN). To estimate the prognostic
              significance of CIN for survival, data from published studies
              have been reviewed and pooled. METHODS: Studies stratifying
              survival in CRC by CIN status were identified by searching PubMed
              and hand-searching bibliographies of identified studies. Two
              reviewers confirmed study eligibility and extracted data
              independently, and data were pooled using a fixed-effects model.
              The principal outcome measure was the HR for death. RESULTS: 63
              eligible studies reported outcome in 10 126 patients, 60.0\% of
              whom had CIN+ (aneuploid/polyploid) tumours. The overall HR
              associated with CIN was 1.45 (95\% CI 1.35 to 1.55, p<0.001). In
              patients with stage II-III CRCs, the HR was 1.45 (95\% CI 1.27 to
              1.65, p<0.001). The effect was similar for progression-free
              survival (HR = 1.71, 95\% CI 1.51 to 1.94, p<0.001). There was no
              evidence of significant interstudy heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: CIN
              is associated with a worse prognosis in CRC, and should be
              evaluated as a prognostic marker, together with MSI status, in

              orders of magnitude. Second, the T cells within this
              proliferating population take on diverse functional and
              phenotypic properties that determine their ability to exert
              effector functions and contribute to T cell memory. Recent
              technological advances in lineage tracing allow us for the first
              time to study these processes in vivo at single-cell resolution.
              Here, we summarize resulting data demonstrating that although
              epitope-specific T cell responses are reproducibly similar at the
              population level, expansion potential and diversification
              patterns of the offspring derived from individual T cells are
              highly variable during both primary and recall immune responses.
              In spite of this stochastic response variation, individual memory
              T cells can serve as adult stem cells that provide robust
              regeneration of an epitope-specific tissue through population

              of research papers reporting its use. In fact, this method has
              become so ingrained in certain areas of research that reports
              often simply state that cells were serum starved without
              providing any factual details as to how the procedure was carried
              out. Even so, we quite obviously lack unequivocal terminology,
              standard protocols, and perhaps most surprisingly, a common
              conceptual basis when performing serum starvation. Such
              inconsistencies not only hinder interstudy comparability but can
              lead to opposing and inconsistent experimental results. Although
              it is frequently assumed that serum starvation reduces basal
              activity of cells, available experimental data do not entirely
              support this notion. To address this important issue, we studied

  abstract = "The molecular origin of standard metabolic rate and thermogenesis
              in mammals is examined. It is pointed out that there are
              important differences and distinctions between the cellular
              reactions that 1) couple to oxygen consumption, 2) uncouple
              metabolism, 3) hydrolyze ATP, 4) control metabolic rate, 5)
              regulate metabolic rate, 6) produce heat, and 7) dissipate free
              energy. The quantitative contribution of different cellular
              reactions to these processes is assessed in mammals. We estimate
              that approximately 90\% of mammalian oxygen consumption in the
              standard state is mitochondrial, of which approximately 20\% is
              uncoupled by the mitochondrial proton leak and 80\% is coupled to
              ATP synthesis. The consequences of the significant contribution
              of proton leak to standard metabolic rate for tissue P-to-O
              ratio, heat production, and free energy dissipation by oxidative
              phosphorylation and the estimated contribution of ATP-consuming
              processes to tissue oxygen consumption rate are discussed. Of the
              80\% of oxygen consumption coupled to ATP synthesis,
              approximately 25-30\% is used by protein synthesis, 19-28\% by
              the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, 4-8\% by the Ca2(+)-ATPase, 2-8\% by the
              actinomyosin ATPase, 7-10\% by gluconeogenesis, and 3\% by
              ureagenesis, with mRNA synthesis and substrate cycling also
              making significant contributions. The main cellular reactions
              that uncouple standard energy metabolism are the Na+, K+, H+, and
              Ca2+ channels and leaks of cell membranes and protein breakdown.
              Cellular metabolic rate is controlled by a number of processes
              including metabolic demand and substrate supply. The differences
              in standard metabolic rate between animals of different body mass
              and phylogeny appear to be due to proportionate changes in the
              whole of energy metabolism. Heat is produced by some reactions
              and taken up by others but is mainly produced by the reactions of
              mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, and proton
              leak on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Free energy is
              dissipated by all cellular reactions, but the major contributions
              are by the ATP-utilizing reactions and the uncoupling reactions.

              Calcifying vascular cells are partly derived from local vascular
              smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), which can undergo chondrogenic or
              osteogenic differentiation under inflammatory environment.
              Recently, we have found activation of CD137 signaling accelerated
              vascular calcification. However, the underlying mechanism remains
              unknown. This study aims to identify key mediators involved in
              CD137 signaling-induced vascular calcification in vivo and in
              vitro. Methods: Autophagy flux was measured through mRFP-GFP-LC3
              adenovirus and transmission electron microscopy. Von Kossa assay
              and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were used to observe
              calcification in vivo and in vitro, respectively.
              Autophagosome-containing vesicles were collected and identified
              by flow cytometry and Western blot. Autophagy or
              calcification-associated targets were measured by Western blot,
              quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Results:
              Treatment with the agonist-CD137 displayed c-Jun N-terminal
              kinase- (JNK-) dependent increase in the expression of various
              markers of autophagy and the number of autophagosomes relative to
              the control group. Autophagy flux experiments suggested that
              agonist-CD137 blocked the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes
              in cultured VSMCs. Calcium deposition, ALP activity, and the
              expression of calcification-associated proteins also increased in
              agonist-CD137 group compared with anti-CD137 group, which could

              Autophagosome-containing vesicles collected from agonist-CD137

              VSMC calcification through the activation of JNK signaling,
              subsequently leading to the disruption of autophagic flux, which

              angiogenic molecules has been shown to inhibit tumor angiogenesis
              and limit tumor growth. Nevertheless, this approach may be
              bypassed by redundant angiogenic pathways. To overcome this
              limitation, we have developed an immunization strategy targeting
              multiple molecules critical to angiogenesis. To this end, hybrids
              of dendritic cells (DC) and syngeneic endothelial cells (EC) were
              used as immunogens, because (a) whole EC express multiple
              molecules involved in angiogenesis and (b) DC tumor cell hybrids
              are effective in generating self-antigen-specific immune
              responses. The immunization strategy included the administration
              of an agonist 4-1BB-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), because

  abstract = "A number of successful systemic therapies are available for
              treatment of disseminated cancers. However, tumor response is
              often transient, and therapy frequently fails due to emergence of
              resistant populations. The latter reflects the temporal and
              spatial heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment as well as
              the evolutionary capacity of cancer phenotypes to adapt to
              therapeutic perturbations. Although cancers are highly dynamic
              systems, cancer therapy is typically administered according to a
              fixed, linear protocol. Here we examine an adaptive therapeutic
              approach that evolves in response to the temporal and spatial
              variability of tumor microenvironment and cellular phenotype as
              well as therapy-induced perturbations. Initial mathematical
              models find that when resistant phenotypes arise in the untreated
              tumor, they are typically present in small numbers because they
              are less fit than the sensitive population. This reflects the
              ``cost'' of phenotypic resistance such as additional substrate
              and energy used to up-regulate xenobiotic metabolism, and
              therefore not available for proliferation, or the growth
              inhibitory nature of environments (i.e., ischemia or hypoxia)
              that confer resistance on phenotypically sensitive cells. Thus,
              in the Darwinian environment of a cancer, the fitter
              chemosensitive cells will ordinarily proliferate at the expense
              of the less fit chemoresistant cells. The models show that, if
              resistant populations are present before administration of
              therapy, treatments designed to kill maximum numbers of cancer
              cells remove this inhibitory effect and actually promote more
              rapid growth of the resistant populations. We present an
              alternative approach in which treatment is continuously modulated
              to achieve a fixed tumor population. The goal of adaptive therapy
              is to enforce a stable tumor burden by permitting a significant
              population of chemosensitive cells to survive so that they, in
              turn, suppress proliferation of the less fit but chemoresistant
              subpopulations. Computer simulations show that this strategy can
              result in prolonged survival that is substantially greater than
              that of high dose density or metronomic therapies. The
              feasibility of adaptive therapy is supported by in vivo
              experiments. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4894-903] Major FindingsWe
              present mathematical analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of
              tumor populations with and without therapy. Analytic solutions
              and numerical simulations show that, with pretreatment,
              therapy-resistant cancer subpopulations are present due to
              phenotypic or microenvironmental factors; maximum dose density
              chemotherapy hastens rapid expansion of resistant populations.
              The models predict that host survival can be maximized if
              ``treatment-for-cure strategy'' is replaced by
              ``treatment-for-stability.'' Specifically, the models predict
              that an optimal treatment strategy will modulate therapy to
              maintain a stable population of chemosensitive cells that can, in
              turn, suppress the growth of resistant populations under normal
              tumor conditions (i.e., when therapy-induced toxicity is absent).
              In vivo experiments using OVCAR xenografts treated with
              carboplatin show that adaptive therapy is feasible and, in this
              system, can produce long-term survival.",

              important clinical implications. To identify distinct therapeutic
              approaches to specifically limit the growth of CIN tumors, we
              focused on a panel of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines,
              previously classified as either chromosomally unstable (CIN(+))
              or diploid/near-diploid (CIN(-)), and treated them individually

               shown no benefit for the vast majority of colorectal cancer
               patients. A better understanding of the complex immunological
               interplay within the microenvironment is required. In this
               study, we utilized wet lab migration experiments and
               quantitative histological data of human colorectal cancer tissue
               samples (n = 20) including tumor cells, lymphocytes, stroma, and
               necrosis to generate a multiagent spatial model. The resulting
               data accurately reflected a wide range of situations of
               successful and failed immune surveillance. Validation of
               simulated tissue outcomes on an independent set of human
               colorectal cancer specimens (n = 37) revealed the model
               recapitulated the spatial layout typically found in human
               tumors. Stroma slowed down tumor growth in a lymphocyte-deprived
               environment but promoted immune escape in a lymphocyte-enriched
               environment. A subgroup of tumors with less stroma and high
               numbers of immune cells showed high rates of tumor control.
               These findings were validated using data from colorectal cancer
               patients (n = 261). Low-density stroma and high lymphocyte
               levels showed increased overall survival (hazard ratio 0.322, P
               = 0.0219) as compared with high stroma and high lymphocyte
               levels. To guide immunotherapy in colorectal cancer, simulation
               of immunotherapy in preestablished tumors showed that a complex
               landscape with optimal stroma permeabilization and immune cell
               activation is able to markedly increase therapy response in
               silico These results can help guide the rational design of

              is growing interest in extending this approach to other
              neoplasms. As such, it is urgent to understand the
              characteristics of a cancer that determine whether or not it will
              respond well to adaptive therapy. A plausible candidate for such
              a selection criterion is the fitness cost of resistance. In this
              article, we study a general, but simple, mathematical model to
              investigate whether the presence of a cost is necessary for
              adaptive therapy to extend the time to progression beyond that of
              a standard-of-care continuous therapy. Tumor cells were divided
              into sensitive and resistant populations and we model their
              competition using a system of two ordinary differential equations
              based on the Lotka-Volterra model. For tumors close to their
              environmental carrying capacity, a cost was not required.
              However, for tumors growing far from carrying capacity, a cost
              may be required to see meaningful gains. Notably, it is important
              to consider cell turnover in the tumor, and we discuss its role
              in modulating the impact of a resistance cost. To conclude, we
              present evidence for the predicted cost-turnover interplay in
              data from 67 patients with prostate cancer undergoing
              intermittent androgen deprivation therapy. Our work helps to

              tissue-specific prevalence patterns that suggest it plays a
              driving role in cancer initiation and progression. However, the
              contribution of aneuploidy to tumorigenesis depends on both
              cellular and genomic contexts. Whole-genome duplication (WGD) is
              a common macroevolutionary event that occurs in more than 30\% of
              human tumors early in tumorigenesis. Although tumors that have
              undergone WGD are reported to be more permissive to aneuploidy,
              it remains unknown whether WGD also affects aneuploidy prevalence
              patterns. Here we analyzed clinical tumor samples from 5,586 WGD-
              tumors and 3,435 WGD+ tumors across 22 tumor types and found
              distinct patterns of aneuploidy in WGD- and WGD+ tumors. WGD+
              tumors were characterized by more promiscuous aneuploidy
              patterns, in line with increased aneuploidy tolerance. Moreover,
              the genetic interactions between chromosome arms differed between
              WGD- and WGD+ tumors, giving rise to distinct cooccurrence and
              mutual exclusivity aneuploidy patterns. The proportion of
              whole-chromosome aneuploidy compared with arm-level aneuploidy
              was significantly higher in WGD+ tumors, indicating distinct
              dominant mechanisms for aneuploidy formation. Human cancer cell
              lines successfully reproduced these WGD/aneuploidy interactions,
              confirming the relevance of studying this phenomenon in culture.
              Finally, induction of WGD and assessment of aneuploidy in
              isogenic WGD-/WGD+ human colon cancer cell lines under standard
              or selective conditions validated key findings from the clinical
              tumor analysis, supporting a causal link between WGD and altered
              aneuploidy landscapes. We conclude that WGD shapes the aneuploidy

              lymphocytes (TIL) has shown promising results in metastatic
              melanoma patients. Although objective response rates of over 50\%
              have been reported, disadvantages of this approach are the
              labor-intensive TIL production and a very high drop-out rate of
              enrolled patients, limiting its widespread applicability.
              Previous studies showed a clear correlation between short TIL
              culture periods and clinical response. Therefore, we used a new
              TIL production technique using unselected, minimally cultured,
              bulk TIL (Young-TIL). The use of Young-TIL is not restricted to
              human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 patients. The purpose of this
              study is to explore the efficacy and toxicity of adoptively
              transferred Young-TIL following lympho-depleting chemotherapy in
              metastatic melanoma patients, refractory to interleukin-2 and
              chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Young-TIL cultures for 90\% of
              the patients were successfully generated, enabling the treatment
              of most enrolled patients. We report here the results of 20
              evaluated patients. RESULTS: Fifty percent of the patients
              achieved an objective clinical response according to the Response

              complete remissions (20+, 4+ months) and eight partial responses

              heavily pretreated patients with metastatic melanoma.
              EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ninety-three patients with measurable
              metastatic melanoma were treated with the adoptive transfer of
              autologous TILs administered in conjunction with interleukin-2
              following a lymphodepleting preparative regimen on three
              sequential clinical trials. Ninety-five percent of these patients
              had progressive disease following a prior systemic treatment.
              Median potential follow-up was 62 months. RESULTS: Objective
              response rates by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
              (RECIST) in the 3 trials using lymphodepleting preparative
              regimens (chemotherapy alone or with 2 or 12 Gy irradiation) were
              49\%, 52\%, and 72\%, respectively. Twenty of the 93 patients
              (22\%) achieved a complete tumor regression, and 19 have ongoing
              complete regressions beyond 3 years. The actuarial 3- and 5-year
              survival rates for the entire group were 36\% and 29\%,
              respectively, but for the 20 complete responders were 100\% and
              93\%. The likelihood of achieving a complete response was similar
              regardless of prior therapy. Factors associated with objective
              response included longer telomeres of the infused cells, the
              number of CD8(+)CD27(+) cells infused, and the persistence of the

              safety and efficacy assessments by searching the FDA website.
              Initial phase I trials for each agent were reviewed and safety
              and efficacy data compared with that found in later trials
              leading to regulatory approvals of the same agents. As of June
              2017, the FDA approved six checkpoint inhibitors for a variety of
              cancer types. All checkpoint inhibitors received a priority
              review status and access to at least two additional FDA special
              access programs, more often breakthrough therapy designation and
              accelerated approval. Median clinical development time
              (investigational new drug application to approval) was 60.77
              months [avelumab had the shortest timeline (52.33 months)].
              Response rates during early phase I trials (median = 16\%) are
              higher than for phase I trials of other agents (with the
              exception of gene-targeted agents tested with a biomarker). Doses
              approved were usually not identical to doses recommended on phase
              I trials. Approximately 50\% of types of immune-related and 43\%
              of types of clinically relevant toxicities from later trials were

              mortality remains exceedingly low in later studies (0.33\% of

              Cergutuzumab amunaleukin (CEA-IL2v) is a novel CEA-targeted

              predict intratumoral CEA-IL2v concentrations following various
              systemic dosing intensities.Experimental Design: Sequential
              measurements of CEA-IL2v plasma concentrations in 74 patients
              with solid tumors were applied in a series of differential
              equations to devise a model that also incorporates the peripheral
              concentrations of IL2 receptor-positive cell populations (i.e.,
              CD8+, CD4+, NK, and B cells), which affect tumor bioavailability
              of CEA-IL2v. Imaging data from a subset of 14 patients were
              subsequently utilized to additionally predict antibody uptake in
              tumor tissues.Results: We created a
              pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic mathematical model that
              incorporates the expansion of IL2R-positive target cells at
              multiple dose levels and different schedules of CEA-IL2v.
              Model-based prediction of drug levels correlated with the
              concentration of IL2R-positive cells in the peripheral blood of
              patients. The pharmacokinetic model was further refined and
              extended by adding a model of antibody uptake, which is based on
              drug dose and the biological properties of the tumor. In silico
              predictions of our model correlated with imaging data and
              demonstrated that a dose-dense schedule comprising escalating
              doses and shortened intervals of drug administration can improve
              intratumoral drug uptake and overcome consumption of CEA-IL2v by

              identify differentially expressed genes associated with
              acquisition of resistance in human gastric cancer cells.
              EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed global gene expression analysis
              in the acquired drug-resistant gastric cancer cell lines to the
              commonly used drugs 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cisplatin

              Our expression analysis also identified eight multidrug

              ADI-PEG20-resistant (ADI(R)) variants from A2058 and SK-Mel-2
              melanoma cells. Compared with the parental lines, these ADI(R)
              variants showed the following characteristics: (i) all ADI(R)

              enhanced AKT signaling and were preferentially sensitive to
              PI3K/AKT inhibitors, but reduced mTOR signaling, and were
              preferentially resistant to mTOR inhibitor; (iii) these variants
              showed enhanced expression of glucose transporter-1 and lactate
              dehydrogenase-A, reduced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase,
              and elevated sensitivity to the glycolytic inhibitors
              2-deoxy-glucose and 3-bromopyruvate, consistent with the enhanced

              and were preferentially vulnerable to glutamine inhibitors. We
              showed that c-Myc, not elevated ASS1 expression, is involved in

              blocks for many tumor cells. The first step in glutamine
              utilization is its conversion to glutamate by the mitochondrial
              enzyme glutaminase. CB-839 is a potent, selective, and orally
              bioavailable inhibitor of both splice variants of glutaminase
              (KGA and GAC). CB-839 had antiproliferative activity in a
              triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, HCC-1806, that
              was associated with a marked decrease in glutamine consumption,
              glutamate production, oxygen consumption, and the steady-state
              levels of glutathione and several tricarboxylic acid cycle
              intermediates. In contrast, no antiproliferative activity was
              observed in an estrogen receptor-positive cell line, T47D, and
              only modest effects on glutamine consumption and downstream
              metabolites were observed. Across a panel of breast cancer cell
              lines, GAC protein expression and glutaminase activity were
              elevated in the majority of TNBC cell lines relative to receptor
              positive cells. Furthermore, the TNBC subtype displayed the
              greatest sensitivity to CB-839 treatment and this sensitivity was
              correlated with (i) dependence on extracellular glutamine for
              growth, (ii) intracellular glutamate and glutamine levels, and
              (iii) GAC (but not KGA) expression, a potential biomarker for

              between higher TMB and favorable outcome parameters; the median
              TMB for responders versus nonresponders treated with
              anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy was 18.0 versus 5.0 mutations/mb (P <

  abstract  = "Abstract. Proliferation is a key phenotypic feature of cancer,
               with higher rates associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Thus
               far, proliferation rates have been measured using pathological
               or experimental techniques on bulk tumor samples. However,
               tumors are heterogeneous compositions of distinct clones.
               Measuring the proliferation of individual clones has been
               unfeasible to date since proliferation and clonal diversity
               cannot easily be measured for the same set of cells, but it is
               potentially important as it may allow the identification of
               clones that develop more aggressive phenotypes (e.g., metastatic
               potential or treatment resistance). We have developed SPRINTER,
               a novel algorithm that uses single-cell whole-genome DNA
               sequencing (scDNA-seq) data to enable the accurate
               identification of actively replicating cells in both the S and
               G2 phases of the cell cycle and their assignment to distinct
               tumor clones, thus providing a proxy to estimate clone-specific
               proliferation rates. To evaluate SPRINTER's accuracy, we
               generated a ground truth dataset of 8,844 diploid and tetraploid
               cancer cells by coupling scDNA-seq with 5-Ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine
               (EdU) labeling, and demonstrated that SPRINTER can accurately
               distinguish clone proliferation rates in contrast to previous
               approaches. We further generated a longitudinal,
               primary-metastasis matched dataset of 23,001 cancer cells
               obtained from 5 samples from the primary tumor and 5 samples
               from distinct metastases from a patient with non-small cell lung
               cancer, allowing us to integrate analyses of proliferation and
               cancer evolution through the metastatic disease course. We
               revealed widespread heterogeneity in clone proliferation rates
               both between and within samples, supported by multiple
               orthogonal analyses including Ki-67 pathology, nuclei microscopy
               imaging, and patient clinical imaging, with high proliferation
               seen in fast-growing metastatic lesions. We demonstrated an
               association between clones with high proliferation and increased
               metastatic potential, as well as increased shedding of
               circulating tumor DNA. We further illustrated SPRINTER's broad
               applicability on previous datasets of 42,009 breast cancer cells
               and 19,905 ovarian cancer cells, revealing an association
               between high proliferation and increased rates of different
               genetic variants. In conclusion, SPRINTER infers the
               proliferation rates of distinct tumor clones from scDNA-seq
               data, allowing the identification of clones with potentially
               aggressive phenotypes, such as metastatic potential.Citation

              use long-term culture of isogenic tetraploid cells from a stable
              diploid colon cancer progenitor to investigate how a
              genome-doubling event affects genome stability over time. Rare
              cells that survive genome doubling demonstrate increased
              tolerance to chromosome aberrations. Tetraploid cells do not
              exhibit increased frequencies of structural or numerical CIN per
              chromosome. However, the tolerant phenotype in tetraploid cells,
              coupled with a doubling of chromosome aberrations per cell,
              allows chromosome abnormalities to evolve specifically in
              tetraploids, recapitulating chromosomal changes in genomically
              complex colorectal tumors. Finally, a genome-doubling event is
              independently predictive of poor relapse-free survival in

              days 3 and 5 after CTL transfer. To investigate the impact of CTL
              therapy on the cell cycle of tumor cells in situ, we generated
              B16 cells expressing a fluorescent ubiquitination-based
              cell-cycle indicator (B16-fucci) and performed CTL therapy in
              mice bearing B16-fucci tumors. Three days after CTL transfer, we

              The mechanism of G1 arrest involved the downregulation of S-phase

              target cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 in the B16-fucci

              regulate tumor growth via IFN$\gamma$-mediated profound
              cytostatic effects rather than via cytotoxicity. This dominance
              of G1 arrest over other mechanisms may be widespread but not

              anti-4-1BB/anti-PD-1 combination was dependent on IFN$\gamma$ and
              CD8(+) T cells. Both 4-1BB and PD-1 proteins were elevated on the

              the tumor microenvironment, an effective antitumor immune

              to elicit a robust antitumor effector/memory T-cell response in

              inactivated by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment,
              through the engagement of inhibitory receptors such as CTLA-4 and
              PD-1. However, antigen-specific CD8+ TILs are not functionally
              inert but are undergoing activation in situ Here, we show that
              antigen-specific CD8+ TILs are actively proliferating, yet also
              undergo high rates of apoptosis, leading to a vicious cycle of
              activation and death that limits immune efficacy. Preventing CD8+
              TIL apoptosis by Bcl-xL overexpression enabled accumulation and
              improved tumor control. Effective combination immunotherapy with
              an agonist 4-1BB mAb plus either CTLA-4 or PD-L1 neutralization

              processes including angiogenesis, metastasis, and the response to
              drugs or immunotherapy. To facilitate the characterization of the
              immune component of tumors from transcriptomics data, a number of
              immune cell transcriptome signatures have been reported that are
              made up of lists of marker genes indicative of the presence a
              given immune cell population. The majority of these gene
              signatures have been defined through analysis of isolated blood
              cells. However, blood cells do not reflect the differentiation or
              activation state of similar cells within tissues, including
              tumors, and consequently markers derived from blood cells do not
              necessarily transfer well to tissues. To address this issue, we
              generated a set of immune gene signatures derived directly from
              tissue transcriptomics data using a network-based deconvolution

              collectively named ImSig, and demonstrate how these markers can
              be used for the quantitative estimation of the immune cell

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Wound healing is accompanied by neoangiogenesis, and
              new vessels are thought to originate primarily from the
              microcirculation; however, how these vessels form and resolve
              during wound healing is poorly understood. Here, we investigated
              properties of the smallest capillaries during wound healing to
              determine their spatial organization and the kinetics of
              formation and resolution. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We used
              intravital imaging and high-resolution microscopy to identify a
              new type of vessel in wounds, called tortuous microvessels.
              Longitudinal studies showed that tortuous microvessels increased
              in frequency after injury, normalized as the wound healed, and
              were closely associated with the wound site. Tortuous
              microvessels had aberrant cell shapes, increased permeability,
              and distinct interactions with circulating microspheres,
              suggesting altered flow dynamics. Moreover, tortuous microvessels
              disproportionately contributed to wound angiogenesis by sprouting
              exuberantly and significantly more frequently than nearby normal
              capillaries. CONCLUSIONS: A new type of transient wound vessel,
              tortuous microvessels, sprout dynamically and disproportionately
              contribute to wound-healing neoangiogenesis, likely as a result
              of altered properties downstream of flow disturbances. These new

              autoimmune T cell responses. To understand the basis for this
              dichotomy in T cell function, CD4 and CD8 antiviral immunity was
              measured in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) Armstrong-
              or A/PR8/34 influenza-infected mice injected with anti-CD137
              mAbs. We found that the timing of administration of anti-CD137
              mAbs profoundly altered the nature of the antiviral immune
              response during acute infection. Antiviral immunity progressed
              normally for the first 72 hours when the mAb was administered
              early in infection before undergoing complete collapse by day 8
              postinfection. Anti-CD137-injected LCMV-infected mice became
              tolerant to, and persistently infected with, LCMV Armstrong.
              Elevated levels of IL-10 early in the response was key to the
              loss of CD4(+) T cells, whereas CD8(+) T cell deletion was
              dependent on a prolonged TNF-alpha response, IL-10, and
              upregulation of Fas. Blocking IL-10 function rescued CD4
              antiviral immunity but not CD8(+) T cell deletion. Anti-CD137
              treatment given beyond 72 hours after infection significantly
              enhanced antiviral immunity. Mice treated with anti-CD137 mAb 1
              day before infection with A/PR8/34 virus experienced 80\%
              mortality compared with 40\% mortality of controls. When
              treatment was delayed until day 1 postinfection, 100\% of the
              infected mice survived. These data show that anti-CD137 mAbs can
              induce T cell activation-induced cell death or enhance antiviral
              immunity depending on the timing of treatment, which may be

              evaluated 3 tumor-bearing mouse models that differ in their
              sensitivity to PD-L1 blockade and demonstrated a loss of
              therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in immunodeficient mice
              and in PD-L1- and PD-1-deficient mice. In contrast, neither
              knockout nor overexpression of PD-L1 in tumor cells had an effect
              on PD-L1 blockade efficacy. Human and murine studies showed high
              levels of functional PD-L1 expression in dendritic cells and
              macrophages in the tumor microenvironments and draining lymph
              nodes. Additionally, expression of PD-L1 on dendritic cells and
              macrophages in ovarian cancer and melanoma patients correlated
              with the efficacy of treatment with either anti-PD-1 alone or in
              combination with anti-CTLA-4. Thus, PD-L1-expressing dendritic

              involves its conversion to glutamate by glutaminase (GA).
              Different GA isoforms are encoded by the genes GLS1 and GLS2 in
              humans. Herein, we show that glutamine levels control
              mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in acute myeloid
              leukemia (AML) cells. Glutaminase C (GAC) is the GA isoform that
              is most abundantly expressed in AML. Both knockdown of GLS1
              expression and pharmacologic GLS1 inhibition by the drug CB-839
              can reduce OXPHOS, leading to leukemic cell proliferation arrest

              signaling cascade that results in upregulation of antiapoptotic
              molecules, cytokine secretion, and enhanced effector function. In
              dysfunctional T cells that have a decreased cytotoxic capacity,
              4-1BB ligation demonstrates a potent ability to restore effector
              functions. On NK cells, 4-1BB signaling can increase
              antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Agonistic
              monoclonal antibodies targeting 4-1BB have been developed to
              harness 4-1BB signaling for cancer immunotherapy. Preclinical
              results in a variety of induced and spontaneous tumor models
              suggest that targeting 4-1BB with agonist antibodies can lead to
              tumor clearance and durable antitumor immunity. Clinical trials
              of 2 agonist antibodies, urelumab and utomilumab, are ongoing.
              Despite initial signs of efficacy, clinical development of
              urelumab has been hampered by inflammatory liver toxicity at
              doses >1 mg/kg. Utomilumab has a superior safety profile, but is
              a less potent 4-1BB agonist relative to urelumab. Both antibodies
              have demonstrated promising results in patients with lymphoma and
              are being tested in combination therapy trials with other
              immunomodulatory agents. In an effort to optimally leverage
              4-1BB-mediated immune activation, the next generation of 4-1BB
              targeting strategies attempts to decouple the observed antitumor
              efficacy from the on-target liver toxicity. Multiple therapeutics
              that attempt to restrict 4-1BB agonism to the tumor
              microenvironment and minimize systemic exposure have emerged.
              4-1BB is a compelling target for cancer immunotherapy and future

              isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) confer
              gain-of-function activity in cancer cells, resulting in
              accumulation of the oncometabolite, R-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG).
              High levels of 2-HG result in epigenetic changes and impaired
              cellular differentiation. IDH mutations have been identified in a
              spectrum of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. AG-221 is
              a first-in-class, oral, potent, reversible, selective inhibitor
              of the IDH2 mutant enzyme. Data from the ongoing, first-in-human,
              Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study of AG-221 are
              presented here [NCT01915498]. METHODS: Patients with advanced
              IDH2 mutation-positive hematologic malignancies are receiving
              AG-221 as a single-agent orally once daily (QD) or twice daily
              (BID) continuously, in 28-day cycles. The dose in the first
              cohort was 30 mg BID and sequentially higher dose levels are now
              ongoing at QD and BID dosing regimens; planned expansion cohorts
              will be enrolled once the recommended Phase II dose is
              identified. Bone marrow is examined on Days 15, 29, 57, and every
              56 days thereafter. The primary objectives are safety and
              determination of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and to select a
              dose and schedule for the expansion cohorts and future Phase II
              studies. Secondary objectives include clinical activity assessed
              by investigators using International Working Group Criteria,
              pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). RESULTS:Since
              study start in September 2013, 48 patients have been dosed and 27
              are on study drug as of July 24, 2014. Parallel BID and QD cohort
              regimens are ongoing at doses up to 150 mg and 200 mg,
              respectively. Therapy has been well tolerated and the MTD has not
              yet been reached. The majority of adverse events reported have
              been grade 1 and 2. There have been 9 deaths and 8 within the
              first 28 days of receiving AG-221. One death reported as possibly
              related to study drug in a subject with severe pneumonia. Eight
              subjects have had 11 SAEs reported as possibly related to study
              drug. Preliminary PK analysis of the 30 mg through 75 mg BID and
              100 mg QD doses demonstrated excellent exposure to AG-221, high
              accumulation after multiple doses, and a mean plasma half-life
              >40 hours. PD evaluation demonstrated sustained plasma 2-HG
              inhibition up to 97\% in R140Q subjects and up to 50\% in R172K
              subjects after multiple doses. As of July 24, 2014, 48 subjects
              have been enrolled: 32 are evaluable for efficacy (having had a
              Day 28 bone marrow), 8 discontinued study prior to Day 28, and 8
              are on study but prior to a Day 28 bone marrow assessment.
              Investigator-assessed objective responses have been observed in
              20 subjects (8 CR, 1 CRp, 3 CRi and 8 PR).Five subjects had
              stable disease and remain on AG-221. Seven subjects have had
              progressive disease. Responses are durable, including complete
              remissions of up to 4.5 months and ongoing with subjects on study
              as long as 8 cycles (1 cycle = 28 days). Five subjects who
              achieved a CR went on to bone marrow transplantation. Additional
              and updated safety, PK/PD and efficacy data from the enrolled
              subjects will be presented. CONCLUSION: AG-221, a potent,
              selective, oral inhibitor of mutated IDH2, is well tolerated in
              patients with advanced hematologic malignancies, and triggers the
              differentiation of leukemic blast cells that ultimately leads to
              objective durable responses, including complete remissions. These
              data provide continued validation of mutant IDH2 as a therapeutic

              been addressed so far. RESULTS: Here we evaluate the
              transcription profiles of eleven trisomic and tetrasomic cell
              lines and two cell lines with complex aneuploid karyotypes. We
              identify a characteristic aneuploidy response pattern defined by
              upregulation of genes linked to endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi
              apparatus and lysosomes, and downregulation of DNA replication,
              transcription as well as ribosomes. Strikingly, complex
              aneuploidy elicits the same transcriptional changes as trisomy.
              To uncover the triggers of the response, we compared the profiles
              with transcription changes in human cells subjected to stress
              conditions. Interestingly, we found an overlap only with the
              response to treatment with the autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin
              A1. Finally, we identified 23 genes whose expression is
              significantly altered in all aneuploids and which may thus serve
              as aneuploidy markers. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis shows that
              despite the variability in chromosome content, aneuploidy
              triggers uniform transcriptional response in human cells. A
              common response independent of the type of aneuploidy might be
              exploited as a novel target for cancer therapy. Moreover, the
              potential aneuploidy markers identified in our analysis might
              represent novel biomarkers to assess the malignant potential of a
              tumor.",

              commonly occurring skin cancer. Melanoma is not only the major
              source (75\%) of deaths related to skin cancer, but also it is
              hard to be treated by the conventional drugs. Recent research
              indicated that angiogenesis is an important factor for tumor
              initiation, expansion, and response to therapy. Thus, we proposed
              a novel multi-scale agent-based computational model that
              integrates the angiogenesis into tumor growth to study the
              response of melanoma cancer under combined drug treatment.
              RESULTS: Our multi-scale agent-based model can simulate the
              melanoma tumor growth with angiogenesis under combined drug
              treatment. The significant synergistic effects between drug Dox
              and drug Sunitinib demonstrated the clinical potential to
              interrupt the communication between melanoma cells and its
              related vasculatures. Also, the sensitivity analysis of the model
              revealed that diffusivity related to the micro-vasculatures
              around tumor tissues closely correlated with the spread,
              oscillation and destruction of the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation

              The model can help cancer researchers understand the melanoma

              uncertainty over how to best model tumor growth. Seven ordinary
              differential equation (ODE) models of tumor growth (exponential,
              Mendelsohn, logistic, linear, surface, Gompertz, and Bertalanffy)
              have been proposed, but there is no clear guidance on how to
              choose the most appropriate model for a particular cancer.
              METHODS: We examined all seven of the previously proposed ODE
              models in the presence and absence of chemotherapy. We derived
              equations for the maximum tumor size, doubling time, and the
              minimum amount of chemotherapy needed to suppress the tumor and
              used a sample data set to compare how these quantities differ

              giant cancer cells (PGCCs). These cells form under the stress of
              chemotherapy and have higher than diploid chromosome content.
              PGCCs are able to then repopulate tumors through an asymmetric
              daughter cell budding process. PGCCs have been observed in
              ovarian cancer histology, including the deadly and common form
              high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC). We previously
              discovered that drugs which disrupt the cellular recycling
              process of autophagy are uniquely efficacious in pre-clinical
              HGSC models. While autophagy induction has been associated with
              PGCCs, it has never been previously investigated if autophagy
              modulation interacts with the PGCC life cycle and this form of
              tumor cell plasticity. METHODS: CAOV3 and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer
              cell lines were treated with carboplatin or docetaxel to induce
              PGCC formation. Microscopy was used to characterize and quantify
              PGCCs formed by chemotherapy. Two clinically available drugs that
              inhibit autophagy, hydroxychloroquine and nelfinavir, and a
              clinically available activator of autophagy, rapamycin, were
              employed to test the effect of these autophagy modulators on PGCC
              induction and subsequent colony formation from PGCCs. Crystal
              violet-stained colony formation assays were used to quantify the
              tumor-repopulating stage of the PGCC life cycle. RESULTS:
              Autophagy inhibitors did not prevent PGCC formation in OVCAR3 or
              CAOV3 cells. Rapamycin did not induce PGCC formation on its own
              nor did it exacerbate PGCC formation by chemotherapy. However,
              hydroxychloroquine prevented efficient colony formation in CAOV3
              PGCCs induced by carboplatin (27\% inhibition) or docetaxel (41\%
              inhibition), as well as in OVCAR3 cells (95\% and 77\%,
              respectively). Nelfinavir similarly prevented colony formation in
              CAOV3 PGCCs induced by carboplatin (64\% inhibition) or docetaxel
              (94\% inhibition) as well as in OVCAR3 cells (89\% and 80\%,
              respectively). Rapamycin surprisingly also prevented PGCC colony
              outgrowth (52-84\% inhibition). CONCLUSIONS: While the autophagy
              previously observed to correlate with PGCC formation is unlikely
              necessary for PGCCs to form, autophagy modulating drugs severely
              impair the ability of HGSC PGCCs to form colonies. Clinical
              trials which utilize hydroxychloroquine, nelfinavir, and/or
              rapamycin after chemotherapy may be of future interest.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The protein homeostasis (proteostasis) network
              maintains balanced protein synthesis, folding, transport, and
              degradation within a cell. Failure to maintain proteostasis is
              associated with aging and disease, leading to concerted efforts
              to study how the network responds to various proteotoxic
              stresses. This is often accomplished using ectopic overexpression
              of well-characterized, model misfolded protein substrates.
              However, how cells tolerate large-scale, diverse burden to the
              proteostasis network is not understood. Aneuploidy, the state of
              imbalanced chromosome content, adversely affects the proteostasis
              network by dysregulating the expression of hundreds of proteins
              simultaneously. Using aneuploid haploid yeast cells as a model,
              we address whether cells can tolerate large-scale, diverse
              challenges to the proteostasis network. RESULTS: Here we
              characterize several aneuploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains
              isolated from a collection of stable, randomly generated yeast
              aneuploid cells. These strains exhibit robust growth and
              resistance to multiple drugs which induce various forms of
              proteotoxic stress. Whole genome re-sequencing of the strains
              revealed this was not the result of genetic mutations, and
              transcriptome profiling combined with ribosome footprinting
              showed that genes are expressed and translated in accordance to
              chromosome copy number. In some strains, various facets of the
              proteostasis network are mildly upregulated without chronic
              activation of environmental stress response or heat shock
              response pathways. No severe defects were observed in the
              degradation of misfolded proteins, using model misfolded
              substrates of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation or
              cytosolic quality control pathways, and protein biosynthesis
              capacity was not impaired. CONCLUSIONS: We show that yeast
              strains of some karyotypes in the genetic background studied here
              can tolerate the large aneuploidy-associated burden to the
              proteostasis machinery without genetic changes, dosage
              compensation, or activation of canonical stress response
              pathways. We suggest that proteotoxic stress, while common, is
              not always an obligate consequence of aneuploidy, but rather
              certain karyotypes and genetic backgrounds may be able to
              tolerate the excess protein burden placed on the protein
              homeostasis machinery. This may help clarify how cancer cells are

              carrier in living organisms, critical for metabolism and
              essential physiological processes. In humans, abnormal regulation
              of energy levels (ATP concentration) and power consumption (ATP
              consumption flux) in cells is associated with numerous diseases
              from cancer, to viral infection and immune dysfunction, while in
              microbes it influences their responses to drugs and other
              stresses. The measurement and modeling of ATP dynamics in cells
              is therefore a critical component in understanding fundamental
              physiology and its role in pathology. Despite the importance of
              ATP, our current understanding of energy dynamics and homeostasis
              in living cells has been limited by the lack of easy-to-use ATP
              sensors and the lack of models that enable accurate estimates of
              energy and power consumption related to these ATP dynamics. Here
              we describe a dynamic model and an ATP reporter that tracks ATP
              in E. coli over different growth phases. RESULTS: The reporter is
              made by fusing an ATP-sensing rrnB P1 promoter with a
              fast-folding and fast-degrading GFP. Good correlations between
              reporter GFP and cellular ATP were obtained in E. coli growing in
              both minimal and rich media and in various strains. The ATP
              reporter can reliably monitor bacterial ATP dynamics in response
              to nutrient availability. Fitting the dynamics of experimental
              data corresponding to cell growth, glucose, acetate, dissolved
              oxygen, and ATP yielded a mathematical and circuit model. This
              model can accurately predict cellular energy and power
              consumption under various conditions. We found that cellular
              power consumption varies significantly from approximately 0.8 and
              0.2 million ATP/s for a tested strain during lag and stationary
              phases to 6.4 million ATP/s during exponential phase, indicating
              ~ 8-30-fold changes of metabolic rates among different growth
              phases. Bacteria turn over their cellular ATP pool a few times
              per second during the exponential phase and slow this rate by ~
              2-5-fold in lag and stationary phases. CONCLUSION: Our rrnB

              simple way to monitor and predict energy and power consumption

              of growth-promoting and growth-restricting mechanisms, whose
              coordinated activity is vital for proper division and
              propagation. Alterations in this regulation may lead to
              uncontrolled proliferation and genomic instability, triggering
              carcinogenesis. Here, we conducted a comprehensive bioinformatic
              analysis of cell cycle-related genes using data from CRISPR/Cas9
              loss-of-function screens performed in four cancer cell lines and
              in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). RESULTS: Cell cycle genes,
              and in particular S phase and checkpoint genes, are highly
              essential for the growth of cancer and pluripotent cells.
              However, checkpoint genes are also found to underlie the
              differences between the cell cycle features of these cell types.
              Interestingly, while growth-promoting cell cycle genes overlap
              considerably between cancer and stem cells, growth-restricting
              cell cycle genes are completely distinct. Moreover,
              growth-restricting genes are consistently less frequent in cancer
              cells than in hESCs. Here we show that most of these genes are
              regulated by the tumor suppressor gene TP53, which is mutated in
              most cancer cells. Therefore, the growth-restriction system in
              cancer cells lacks important factors and does not function
              properly. Intriguingly, M phase genes are specifically essential
              for the growth of hESCs and are highly abundant among
              hESC-enriched genes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the

  author   = "Schr{\"o}der, Christopher and Rahmann, Sven",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Mixtures of beta distributions are a flexible tool
              for modeling data with values on the unit interval, such as
              methylation levels. However, maximum likelihood parameter
              estimation with beta distributions suffers from problems because
              of singularities in the log-likelihood function if some
              observations take the values 0 or 1. METHODS: While ad-hoc
              corrections have been proposed to mitigate this problem, we
              propose a different approach to parameter estimation for beta
              mixtures where such problems do not arise in the first place. Our
              algorithm combines latent variables with the method of moments
              instead of maximum likelihood, which has computational advantages
              over the popular EM algorithm. RESULTS: As an application, we
              demonstrate that methylation state classification is more
              accurate when using adaptive thresholds from beta mixtures than
              non-adaptive thresholds on observed methylation levels. We also
              demonstrate that we can accurately infer the number of mixture
              components. CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid algorithm between
              likelihood-based component un-mixing and moment-based parameter
              estimation is a robust and efficient method for beta mixture
              estimation. We provide an implementation of the method

              in which cells have abnormal numbers of chromosomes, and is found
              in two out of three cancers. In a chromosomal instable p53
              deficient mouse model with accelerated lymphomagenesis, we
              previously observed whole chromosome copy number changes
              affecting all lymphoma cells. This suggests that chromosome
              instability is somehow suppressed in the aneuploid lymphomas or
              that selection for frequently lost/gained chromosomes
              out-competes the CIN-imposed mis-segregation. RESULTS: To
              distinguish between these explanations and to examine karyotype
              dynamics in chromosome instable lymphoma, we use a newly
              developed single-cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) platform
              that provides a complete and unbiased overview of copy number
              variations (CNV) in individual cells. To analyse these scWGS
              data, we develop AneuFinder, which allows annotation of copy
              number changes in a fully automated fashion and quantification of
              CNV heterogeneity between cells. Single-cell sequencing and
              AneuFinder analysis reveals high levels of copy number
              heterogeneity in chromosome instability-driven murine T-cell
              lymphoma samples, indicating ongoing chromosome instability.
              Application of this technology to human B cell leukaemias reveals
              different levels of karyotype heterogeneity in these cancers.
              CONCLUSION: Our data show that even though aneuploid tumours
              select for particular and recurring chromosome combinations,
              single-cell analysis using AneuFinder reveals copy number
              heterogeneity. This suggests ongoing chromosome instability that
              other platforms fail to detect. As chromosome instability might
              drive tumour evolution, karyotype analysis using single-cell

              described more than 80 years ago, only recently has this term
              been used to explain a mechanism of cell death linked to delayed
              mitosis. Several mechanisms have been suggested for mitotic
              catastrophe development and cell fate. Depending on molecular
              perturbations, mitotic catastrophe can end in three types of cell
              death, namely apoptosis, necrosis, or autophagy. Moreover,
              mitotic catastrophe can be associated with different types of
              cell aging, the development of which negatively affects tumor
              elimination and, consequently, reduces the therapeutic effect.
              The effective triggering of mitotic catastrophe in clinical

              of the molecular pathways that regulate cell cycle arrest and DNA

              cause tumor rejection by blocking negative signaling from the
              B7-CTLA-4 interactions to enhance priming of na{\"\i}ve T cells
              in the lymphoid organs. Recently, we reported that anti-CTLA-4
              antibody Ipilimumab effectively induces tumor rejection in vivo
              although it blocks neither B7 transendocytosis by CTLA-4 nor
              CTLA-4 binding to immobilized or cell-associated B7. Using
              genetic model in which the anti-CTLA-4 antibodies are unable to
              engage more than 50\% of CTLA-4, we demonstrated that saturating
              binding of CTLA-4 is not necessary for tumor rejection. Our
              results argue against B7-CTLA-4 blockade as the mechanism of
              action for the clinically effective Ipilimumab. Moreover,
              Ipilimumab induces tumor rejection even in the absence of de novo

              inconsistent with key provisions of the prevailing hypothesis on
              mechanism of action by anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. Furthermore,
              anti-CTLA-4 antibodies effectively induce depletion of regulatory

              co-opt normal physiologic processes to promote growth and
              invasion. Cancer cell heterogeneity increases cancer's ability to
              test strategies to adapt to microenvironmental stresses. Hypoxia
              and treatment can select for cancer stem cells and drive invasion
              and resistance. Cell-based computational models (also known as
              discrete models, agent-based models, or individual-based models)
              simulate individual cells as they interact in virtual tissues,
              which allows us to explore how single-cell behaviors lead to the
              dynamics we observe and work to control in cancer systems. In
              this review, we introduce the broad range of techniques available
              for cell-based computational modeling. The approaches can range
              from highly detailed models of just a few cells and their
              morphologies to millions of simpler cells in three-dimensional
              tissues. Modeling individual cells allows us to directly
              translate biologic observations into simulation rules. In many
              cases, individual cell agents include molecular-scale models.
              Most models also simulate the transport of oxygen, drugs, and
              growth factors, which allow us to link cancer development to
              microenvironmental conditions. We illustrate these methods with
              examples drawn from cancer hypoxia, angiogenesis, invasion, stem
              cells, and immunosurveillance. An ecosystem of interoperable
              cell-based simulation tools is emerging at a time when cloud

              supercomputing resources make large-scale simulation studies
              possible. As the field develops, we anticipate that
              high-throughput simulation studies will allow us to rapidly
              explore the space of biologic possibilities, prescreen new

              Pharmacodynamic studies indicated an ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw dose
              level of 160 U/m(2) was sufficient to lower plasma arginine from

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Individuals with metastatic melanoma have a poor
              prognosis. Many human melanomas are auxotrophic for arginine, and
              arginine is not an essential amino acid in humans. We
              hypothesized that this auxotrophy may be therapeutically
              exploited. A novel amino acid-degrading enzyme (arginine
              deiminase) conjugated to polyethylene glycol (ADI-SS PEG 20,000
              mw) was used to lower plasma arginine in individuals with
              metastatic melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two cohort
              dose-escalation studies were performed. A phase I study in the
              United States enrolled 15 patients, and a phase I to II study in
              Italy enrolled 24 patients. The Italian patients also received
              two subsequent cycles of treatment, each consisting of four
              once-weekly injections of 160 U/m2. The goals of these studies
              were to determine pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD),
              safety, and the antitumor activity of ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw.
              RESULTS: PK and PD studies indicated that a dose of 160 U/m2
              lowered plasma arginine from a resting level of approximately 130
              micromol/L to less than 2 micromol/L for at least 7 days; nitric
              oxide levels also were lowered. There were no grade 3 or 4
              toxicities directly attributable to the drug. Six of 24 phase I
              to II patients responded to treatment (five partial responses and
              one complete response; 25\% response rate) and also had prolonged
              survival. CONCLUSION Elimination of all detectable plasma
              arginine in patients with metastatic melanoma was well tolerated
              and may be effective in the treatment of this cancer. Further
              testing of ADI-SS PEG 20,000 mw in a larger population of
              individuals with metastatic melanoma is warranted.",

              whole-genome sequencing have shown genomic diversity within
              leukemic clones. The aim of this study was to address clonal
              heterogeneity in AML based on metaphase cytogenetics. PATIENTS
              AND METHODS: This analysis included all patients enrolled onto
              two consecutive, prospective, randomized multicenter trials of
              the Study Alliance Leukemia. Patients were newly diagnosed with
              non-M3 AML and were fit for intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS:
              Cytogenetic subclones were detected in 418 (15.8\%) of 2,639
              patients from the whole study population and in 418 (32.8\%) of
              1,274 patients with aberrant karyotypes. Among those, 252
              karyotypes (60.3\%) displayed a defined number of distinct
              subclones, and 166 (39.7\%) were classified as composite
              karyotypes. Subclone formation was particularly frequent in the
              cytogenetically adverse group, with subclone formation in 69.0\%,
              67.1\%, and 64.8\% of patients with complex aberrant, monosomal,
              and abnl(17p) karyotypes (P < .001 each). Two-subclone patterns
              typically followed a mother-daughter evolution, whereas for
              $\geq$ three subclones, a branched pattern prevailed. In non-core
              binding factor AML, subclone formation was associated with
              inferior event-free and overall survival and was confirmed as an
              independent predictor of poor prognosis in multivariate analysis.
              Subgroup analysis showed that subclone formation adds prognostic
              information particularly in the cytogenetic adverse-risk group.
              Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation improved the prognosis of
              patients with subclone karyotypes as shown in landmark analyses.
              CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic subclones are frequent in AML and permit
              tracing of clonal evolution and architecture. They bear
              prognostic significance with clonal heterogeneity as an
              independent adverse prognostic marker in cytogenetically
              adverse-risk AML.",

              expressed by activated T cells that downmodulates effector
              functions and limits the generation of immune memory. PD-1
              blockade can mediate tumor regression in a substantial proportion
              of patients with melanoma, but it is not known whether this is
              associated with extended survival or maintenance of response
              after treatment is discontinued. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients
              with advanced melanoma (N = 107) enrolled between 2008 and 2012
              received intravenous nivolumab in an outpatient setting every 2
              weeks for up to 96 weeks and were observed for overall survival,
              long-term safety, and response duration after treatment
              discontinuation. RESULTS: Median overall survival in
              nivolumab-treated patients (62\% with two to five prior systemic
              therapies) was 16.8 months, and 1- and 2-year survival rates were
              62\% and 43\%, respectively. Among 33 patients with objective
              tumor regressions (31\%), the Kaplan-Meier estimated median
              response duration was 2 years. Seventeen patients discontinued
              therapy for reasons other than disease progression, and 12 (71\%)
              of 17 maintained responses off-therapy for at least 16 weeks
              (range, 16 to 56+ weeks). Objective response and toxicity rates
              were similar to those reported previously; in an extended
              analysis of all 306 patients treated on this trial (including
              those with other cancer types), exposure-adjusted toxicity rates
              were not cumulative. CONCLUSION: Overall survival following
              nivolumab treatment in patients with advanced
              treatment-refractory melanoma compares favorably with that in
              literature studies of similar patient populations. Responses were
              durable and persisted after drug discontinuation. Long-term
              safety was acceptable. Ongoing randomized clinical trials will
              further assess the impact of nivolumab therapy on overall
              survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.",

              human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive sarcoma
              received escalating doses (1 $\times$ 10(4)/m(2) to 1 $\times$
              10(8)/m(2)) of T cells expressing an HER2-specific chimeric
              antigen receptor with a CD28.$\zeta$ signaling domain (HER2-CAR T
              cells). RESULTS: We enrolled 19 patients with HER2-positive
              tumors (16 osteosarcomas, one Ewing sarcoma, one primitive
              neuroectodermal tumor, and one desmoplastic small round cell
              tumor). HER2-CAR T-cell infusions were well tolerated with no
              dose-limiting toxicity. At dose level 3 (1 $\times$ 10(5)/m(2))
              and above, we detected HER2-CAR T cells 3 hours after infusion by
              quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 14 of 16 patients.
              HER2-CAR T cells persisted for at least 6 weeks in seven of the
              nine evaluable patients who received greater than 1 $\times$
              10(6)/m(2) HER2-CAR T cells (P = .005). HER2-CAR T cells were
              detected at tumor sites of two of two patients examined. Of 17
              evaluable patients, four had stable disease for 12 weeks to 14
              months. Three of these patients had their tumor removed, with one
              showing $\geq$ 90\% necrosis. The median overall survival of all
              19 infused patients was 10.3 months (range, 5.1 to 29.1 months).
              CONCLUSION: This first evaluation of the safety and efficacy of
              HER2-CAR T cells in patients with cancer shows the cells can
              persist for 6 weeks without evident toxicities, setting the stage

              being conducted in patients with inoperable or metastatic solid
              tumors. We report here the results from the UBC expansion cohort.
              Durvalumab (MEDI4736, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered
              intravenously for up to 12 months. The primary end point was

              tumor cells or tumor-infiltrating immune cells expressing
              membrane PD-L1. RESULTS: A total of 61 patients (40
              PD-L1-positive, 21 PD-L1-negative), 93.4\% of whom received one
              or more prior therapies for advanced disease, were treated
              (median duration of follow-up, 4.3 months). The most common
              treatment-related adverse events (AEs) of any grade were fatigue
              (13.1\%), diarrhea (9.8\%), and decreased appetite (8.2\%). Grade
              3 treatment-related AEs occurred in three patients (4.9\%); there
              were no treatment-related grade 4 or 5 AEs. One treatment-related
              AE (acute kidney injury) resulted in treatment discontinuation.
              The ORR was 31.0\% (95\% CI, 17.6 to 47.1) in 42
              response-evaluable patients, 46.4\% (95\% CI, 27.5 to 66.1) in

              responding patients, with median duration of response not yet

               revolutionized the treatment of patients with advanced melanoma.
               However, novel combinations are needed to optimize the
               benefit-risk profile. Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3)
               regulates an immune checkpoint pathway, which inhibits T-cell
               activity, and is upregulated in many tumor types including
               melanoma. Relatlimab (RELA), a human IgG4 LAG-3-blocking
               antibody, restores effector function of exhausted T cells. RELA
               in combination with nivolumab (NIVO; anti-programmed death
               [PD]-1) modulates potentially synergistic immune checkpoint
               pathways and can enhance antitumor immune responses.
               RELATIVITY-047 is a global, randomized, double-blind, phase
               II/III study evaluating a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor
               combination of RELA+NIVO as a fixed-dose combination (FDC)
               treatment in first-line advanced melanoma. Methods: Patients
               with previously untreated advanced melanoma were randomized 1:1
               to receive RELA 160 mg + NIVO 480 mg FDC intravenously (IV)
               every 4 weeks (Q4W) or NIVO monotherapy 480 mg IV Q4W,
               stratified by LAG-3 expression, programmed death ligand 1
               expression, BRAF mutation status, and AJCC (v8) M stage. The
               primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST
               v1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review.
               Secondary endpoints were overall survival and objective response
               rate. PFS in prespecified subgroups and safety were additional
               objectives. Results: 714 patients were randomized to RELA+NIVO
               FDC (n = 355) or NIVO (n = 359). Patient characteristics were
               well balanced between treatment groups. Median follow-up was
               13.2 months. Median PFS in the RELA+NIVO FDC group (10.1 months
               [95\% CI, 6.4?15.7]) was significantly longer than in the NIVO
               group (4.6 months [95\% CI, 3.4?5.6]; hazard ratio, 0.75 [95\%
               CI, 0.6?0.9]; P = 0.0055). PFS rates at 12 months were 47.7\%
               (95\% CI, 41.8?53.2) and 36.0\% (95\% CI, 30.5?41.6) for
               RELA+NIVO FDC and NIVO, respectively. PFS favored RELA+NIVO FDC
               across key prespecified subgroups. The incidence of grade 3/4
               treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) was higher in the
               RELA+NIVO FDC group (18.9\%) versus NIVO (9.7\%). There were 3
               treatment-related deaths with RELA+NIVO FDC and 2 with NIVO.
               TRAEs (any grade) led to treatment discontinuation in 14.6\% and
               6.7\% of patients in the RELA+NIVO FDC and NIVO groups,
               respectively. Conclusions: First-line treatment with RELA+NIVO
               FDC demonstrated a statistically significant PFS benefit
               compared to NIVO monotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma.
               RELA+NIVO FDC was well tolerated with a manageable safety

              proliferation is drastically reduced, but resumes when food
              becomes available. Here, we investigate how neural progenitors
              halt cell division in response to nutrient restriction and

              that nutrient restriction causes neural progenitors to arrest in

              nutrient availability triggers progenitors to re-enter the cell
              cycle at M phase. Initiation of the nutrient restriction-induced
              G2 arrest is rapamycin insensitive, but cell cycle re-entry

              result from pathophysiological events that are caused by
              viral-induced cell fusion or erroneous cell division.
              Tetraploidization can initiate chromosomal instability (CIN),
              probably owing to supernumerary centrosomes and the doubled

              a stably propagating but aneuploid karyotype. Both CIN and stable

              study, we have combined a detailed analysis of aneuploid clones
              isolated from laboratory-evolved populations of Saccharomyces
              cerevisiae with a systematic, genome-wide screen for the fitness
              effects of telomeric amplifications to address the relationship
              between aneuploidy and cellular fitness. We found that aneuploid
              clones rise to high population frequencies in nutrient-limited

              type. Direct competition experiments confirmed that three out of
              four aneuploid events isolated from evolved populations were
              themselves sufficient to improve fitness. To expand the scope
              beyond this small number of exemplars, we created a genome-wide
              collection of >1,800 diploid yeast strains, each containing a
              different telomeric amplicon (Tamp), ranging in size from 0.4 to
              1,000 kb. Using pooled competition experiments in
              nutrient-limited chemostats followed by high-throughput
              sequencing of strain-identifying barcodes, we determined the
              fitness effects of these >1,800 Tamps under three different
              conditions. Our data revealed that the fitness landscape explored
              by telomeric amplifications is much broader than that explored by
              single-gene amplifications. As also observed in the evolved
              clones, we found the fitness effects of most Tamps to be
              condition specific, with a minority showing common effects in all

              examined the fitness effects of single-gene amplifications
              genome-wide, we found that a small number of genes within each
              Tamp are centrally responsible for each Tamp's fitness effects.
              Our genome-wide Tamp screen confirmed that telomeric
              amplifications identified in laboratory-evolved populations
              generally increased fitness. Our results show that Tamps are

              killing on the target cell populations. It is not known how these
              population-level parameters relate to single-cell properties. To
              address this question, we developed a three-dimensional cellular
              automaton model of the region of the spleen where CTL killing
              takes place. The cellular automaton model describes the movement
              of different cell populations and their interactions. Cell
              movement patterns in our cellular automaton model agree with

              described by a term which is linear in the target cell frequency

              syngeneic tumor (Lewis lung carcinoma) and an orthotopically
              xenografted human breast carcinoma. The goals were threefold: 1)
              to determine a statistical model for description of the
              measurement error, 2) to establish the descriptive power of each
              model, using several goodness-of-fit metrics and a study of
              parametric identifiability, and 3) to assess the models' ability
              to forecast future tumor growth. The models included in the study
              comprised the exponential, exponential-linear, power law,
              Gompertz, logistic, generalized logistic, von Bertalanffy and a
              model with dynamic carrying capacity. For the breast data, the
              dynamics were best captured by the Gompertz and
              exponential-linear models. The latter also exhibited the highest
              predictive power, with excellent prediction scores ($\geq$80\%)
              extending out as far as 12 days in the future. For the lung data,
              the Gompertz and power law models provided the most parsimonious

              the models was able to achieve a substantial prediction rate

              adjunction of a priori information on the parameter distribution

              rates went from 14.9\% to 62.7\% when using the power law model
              to predict the full future tumor growth curves, using just three

              range of cytokine communication is a crucial, yet poorly
              understood, functional property. Both containment of cytokine
              action in narrow junctions between immune cells (immunological
              synapses) and global signaling throughout entire lymph nodes have
              been proposed, but the conditions under which they might occur
              are not clear. Here we analyze spatially three-dimensional
              reaction-diffusion models for the dynamics of cytokine signaling
              at two successive scales: in immunological synapses and in dense
              multicellular environments. For realistic parameter values, we
              observe local spatial gradients, with the cytokine concentration
              around secreting cells decaying sharply across only a few cell
              diameters. Focusing on the well-characterized T-cell cytokine
              interleukin-2, we show how cytokine secretion and competitive
              uptake determine this signaling range. Uptake is shaped locally
              by the geometry of the immunological synapse. However, even for
              narrow synapses, which favor intrasynaptic cytokine consumption,
              escape fluxes into the extrasynaptic space are expected to be
              substantial ($\geq$20\% of secretion). Hence paracrine signaling
              will generally extend beyond the synapse but can be limited to
              cellular microenvironments through uptake by target cells or
              strong competitors, such as regulatory T cells. By contrast,
              long-range cytokine signaling requires a high density of cytokine
              producers or weak consumption (e.g., by sparsely distributed
              target cells). Thus in a physiological setting, cytokine
              gradients between cells, and not bulk-phase concentrations, are
              crucial for cell-to-cell communication, emphasizing the need for

              cells with heterogeneous karyotypes. A stochastic model tracing
              cellular karyotypes derived from clonal populations over hundreds

              validated, and it was capable of predicting favorable karyotypes

              Markov chain that precisely describes karyotypic evolution during
              clonally expanding cancer cell populations. The Markov chain
              allows us to directly predict the distribution of karyotypes and
              the expected size of the tumor after many cell divisions without
              resorting to computationally expensive simulations. We determine
              the limiting karyotype distribution of an evolving tumor
              population, and quantify its dependency on several key parameters
              including the initial karyotype of the founder cell, the rate of
              whole chromosome missegregation, and chromosome-specific cell
              viability. Using this model, we confirm the existence of an
              optimal rate of chromosome missegregation probabilities that
              maximizes karyotypic heterogeneity, while minimizing the
              occurrence of nullisomy. Interestingly, karyotypic heterogeneity
              is significantly more dependent on chromosome missegregation
              probabilities rather than the number of cell divisions, so that
              maximal heterogeneity can be reached rapidly (within a few
              hundred generations of cell division) at chromosome
              missegregation rates commonly observed in cancer cell lines.
              Conversely, at low missegregation rates, heterogeneity is
              constrained even after thousands of cell division events. This
              leads us to conclude that chromosome copy number heterogeneity is
              primarily constrained by chromosome missegregation rates and the
              risk for nullisomy and less so by the age of the tumor. This

              with dominant-negative Chk1 mutants or pharmacological Chk1
              inhibition killed tetraploid colon cancer cells yet had minor
              effects on their diploid counterparts. Chk1 inhibition abolished
              the spindle assembly checkpoint and caused premature and abnormal
              mitoses that led to p53 activation and cell death at a higher
              frequency in tetraploid than in diploid cells. Similarly,
              abolition of the spindle checkpoint by knockdown of Bub1, BubR1
              or Mad2 induced p53-dependent apoptosis of tetraploid cells. Chk1
              inhibition reversed the cisplatin resistance of tetraploid cells
              in vitro and in vivo, in xenografted human cancers. Chk1
              inhibition activated p53-regulated transcripts including
              Puma/BBC3 in tetraploid but not in diploid tumor cells.
              Altogether, our results demonstrate that, in tetraploid tumor
              cells, the inhibition of Chk1 sequentially triggers aberrant
              mitosis, p53 activation and Puma/BBC3-dependent mitochondrial

              phosphorylase: a novel strategy",
  author   = "Lubin, Martin and Lubin, Adam",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The gene for methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)
              lies on 9p21, close to the gene CDKN2A that encodes the tumor
              suppressor proteins p16 and p14ARF. MTAP and CDKN2A are
              homozygously co-deleted, with a frequency of 35 to 70\%, in lung
              and pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, soft-tissue
              sarcoma, mesothelioma, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
              In normal cells, but not in tumor cells lacking MTAP, MTAP
              cleaves the natural substrate, 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine
              (MTA), to adenine and 5-methylthioribose-1-phosphate (MTR-1-P),
              which are then converted to adenine nucleotides and methionine.
              This distinct difference between normal MTAP-positive cells and
              tumor MTAP-negative cells led to several proposals for therapy.
              We offer a novel strategy in which both MTA and a toxic adenine
              analog, such as 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP), 6-methylpurine (MeP), or
              2-fluoroadenine (F-Ade), are administered. In MTAP-positive
              cells, abundant adenine, generated from supplied MTA,
              competitively blocks the conversion of an analog, by adenine
              phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), to its active nucleotide form.
              In MTAP-negative tumor cells, the supplied MTA cannot generate
              adenine; hence conversion of the analog is not blocked. PRINCIPAL
              FINDINGS: We show that this combination treatment--adenine analog
              plus MTA--kills MTAP-negative A549 lung tumor cells, while
              MTAP-positive human fibroblasts (HF) are protected. In
              co-cultures of the breast tumor cell line, MCF-7, and HF cells,
              MCF-7 is inhibited or killed, while HF cells proliferate
              robustly. 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG) may also
              be used with our strategy. Though neither analog is activated by
              APRT, in MTAP-positive cells, adenine produced from supplied MTA
              blocks conversion of 5-FU and 6-TG to their toxic nucleotide
              forms by competing for 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP).
              The combination of MTA with 5-FU or 6-TG, in the treatment of
              MTAP-negative tumors, may produce a significantly improved
              therapeutic index. CONCLUSION: We describe a selective strategy
              to kill tumor cells lacking MTAP.",

               mouse spleens with varying numbers of epitope-specific CD8 T

               mass-action, i.e., the death rate of individual target cells
               remains proportional to the frequency (or the total number) of

               effector cell densities and effector to target ratios vary about

              is still low. Recent studies have revealed that cell cycle is a
              key parameter driving epigenetic reprogramming to pluripotency.
              As is well known, retroviruses such as the Moloney murine
              leukemia virus (MoMLV) require cell division to integrate into
              the host genome and replicate, whereas the target primary cells
              for reprogramming are a mixture of several cell types with
              different cell cycle rhythms. Whether cell cycle synchronization
              has potential effect on retrovirus induced reprogramming has not
              been detailed. In this study, utilizing transient serum
              starvation induced synchronization, we demonstrated that
              starvation generated a reversible cell cycle arrest and
              synchronously progressed through G2/M phase after release,
              substantially improving retroviral infection efficiency.
              Interestingly, synchronized human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) and
              adipose stem cells (ASC) exhibited more homogenous epithelial
              morphology than normal FBS control after infection, and the
              expression of epithelial markers such as E-cadherin and Epcam
              were strongly activated. Futhermore, synchronization treatment
              ultimately improved Nanog positive clones, achieved a 15-20 fold
              increase. These results suggested that cell cycle synchronization
              promotes the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and

  abstract = "Modeling of interstitial fluid flow involves processes such as
              fluid diffusion, convective transport in extracellular matrix,
              and extravasation from blood vessels. To date, majority of
              microvascular flow modeling has been done at different levels and
              scales mostly on simple tumor shapes with their capillaries.
              However, with our proposed numerical model, more complex and
              realistic tumor shapes and capillary networks can be studied.
              Both blood flow through a capillary network, which is induced by
              a solid tumor, and fluid flow in tumor's surrounding tissue are
              formulated. First, governing equations of angiogenesis are
              implemented to specify the different domains for the network and
              interstitium. Then, governing equations for flow modeling are
              introduced for different domains. The conservation laws for mass
              and momentum (including continuity equation, Darcy's law for
              tissue, and simplified Navier-Stokes equation for blood flow
              through capillaries) are used for simulating interstitial and

              blood flow, and phase separation of blood flow in capillary
              bifurcation. The incorporation of the outlined components beyond

              the formation of thrombus, and possibly heart attack. It has long
              been recognized that the formation of a plaque relates to the
              cholesterol concentration in the blood. For example, individuals
              with LDL above 190 mg/dL and HDL below 40 mg/dL are at high risk,

  abstract = "Cancer can be viewed as an emergent behavior in terms of complex
              system theory and artificial life, Cellular Automata (CA) being
              the tool most used for studying and characterizing the emergent
              behavior. Different approaches with CA models were used to model
              cancer growth. The use of the abstract model of acquired cancer
              hallmarks permits the direct modeling at cellular level, where a
              cellular automaton defines the mitotic and apoptotic behavior of
              cells, and allows for an analysis of different dynamics of the
              cellular system depending on the presence of the different
              hallmarks. A CA model based on the presence of hallmarks in the
              cells, which includes a simulation of the behavior of Cancer Stem
              Cells (CSC) and their implications for the resultant growth
              behavior of the multicellular system, was employed. This modeling
              of cancer growth, in the avascular phase, was employed to analyze
              the effect of cancer treatments in a cancer stem cell context.
              The model clearly explains why, after treatment against non-stem
              cancer cells, the regrowth capability of CSCs generates a faster
              regrowth of tumor behavior, and also shows that a continuous
              low-intensity treatment does not favor CSC proliferation and
              differentiation, thereby allowing an unproblematic control of
              future tumor regrowth. The analysis performed indicates that,
              contrary to the current attempts at CSC control, trying to make
              CSC proliferation more difficult is an important point to
              consider, especially in the immediate period after a standard
              treatment for controlling non-stem cancer cell proliferation.",

              sprouting or splitting of existing blood vessels. During
              sprouting, a highly motile type of endothelial cell, called the
              tip cell, migrates from the blood vessels followed by stalk
              cells, an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the
              sprout. To get more insight into how tip cells contribute to
              angiogenesis, we extended an existing computational model of
              vascular network formation based on the cellular Potts model with
              tip and stalk differentiation, without making a priori
              assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk
              cells. To predict potential differences, we looked for parameter
              values that make tip cells (a) move to the sprout tip, and (b)
              change the morphology of the angiogenic networks. The screening
              predicted that if tip cells respond less effectively to an
              endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells, they move to the
              tips of the sprouts, which impacts the morphology of the
              networks. A comparison of this model prediction with genes

              the model prediction. To test the model prediction we inhibited
              Apelin signaling in our model and in an in vitro model of
              angiogenic sprouting, and found that in both cases inhibition of
              Apelin or of its receptor APJ reduces sprouting. Based on the
              prediction of the computational model, we propose that the
              differential expression of Apelin and APJ yields a

              checkpoint inhibitor, which enables the T cells to remain active

              in the sense that an increase in the amount of each drug results

              tumors. This model is relatively simple and involves (i) surgical
              opening of the ear skin, (ii) removal of a square-piece of
              cartilage followed by (iii) the implantation of tumor cells with
              fibrin gel. The remodeling of the fibrin gel within the cartilage
              chamber, accompanying tumor proliferation, results in the
              formation of blood vessels, lymphatics and tissue matrix that can
              be readily distinguished from the pre-existing skin structures.
              Moreover, this method avoids the injection-enforced artificial
              spread of cells into the pre-existing lymphatic vessels. The
              tumors have a highly reproducible exponential growth pattern with
              a tumor doubling time of around 1.8 days, reaching an average
              volume of 85mm3 16 days after implantation. The melanomas are
              densely cellular with proliferative indices of between 60 and

              date. In particular, we have focused on the hypothesis that
              ploidy changes have influenced adaptive processes. We sequenced
              144 yeast strains, 132 of which are clinical isolates. We found
              pervasive large-scale genomic variation in both overall ploidy
              (34\% of strains identified as 3n/4n) and individual chromosomal
              copy numbers (36\% of strains identified as aneuploid). We also
              found evidence for the highly dynamic nature of yeast genomes,

              expected under neutral evolution and described statistically by
              Kingman's coalescent. While differences in the statistical
              structure of genealogies have long been used as a test for the
              presence of selection, the full extent of the information that
              they contain has not been exploited. Here we demonstrate that the
              shape of the reconstructed genealogical tree for a moderately
              large number of random genomic samples taken from a fitness
              diverse, but otherwise unstructured, asexual population can be
              used to predict the relative fitness of individuals within the

              test in silico, using simulations of a Wright-Fisher model for a
              realistic range of mutation rates and selection strength. Our
              inferred fitness ranking is based on a linear discriminator that
              identifies rapidly coalescing lineages in the reconstructed tree.
              Inferred fitness ranking correlates strongly with actual fitness,
              with a genome in the top 10\% ranked being in the top 20\%
              fittest with false discovery rate of 0.1-0.3, depending on the

              overproduction of reactive oxygen species, which are the major
              hallmarks of mitochondrial diseases. Abundant evidence has
              suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction-elicited oxidative
              stress can play an important role in the pathogenesis and
              progression of mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondria can respond

              number of molecular events to help the human cells to cope with
              physiological or environmental changes. In this article, we first
              describe oxidative stress-induced cellular responses including
              metabolic adaptation, compensatory increase of mitochondrial
              biogenesis, upregulation of antioxidant enzymes, and alteration

              mitochondria and the antioxidant defense system to respond to
              energy deficiency and oxidative stress, which contribute to the
              adaptive metabolic reprogramming in mitochondrial diseases. In
              addition, we emphasize the critical role of the activation of
              AMPK, Sirt1 and Sirt3 in the metabolic adaptation of human cells
              harboring mitochondrial DNA mutations. Recent studies have
              revealed that AMPK and sirtuins-mediated signaling pathways are
              involved in metabolic reprogramming, which is effected by
              upregulation of antioxidant defense system and mitochondrial
              protein acetylation, in human cells with mitochondrial
              dysfunction. Finally, we discuss several potential modulators of

              mechanism for generating cancer cells with extra centrosomes is

              responses, maintain homeostasis and prevent self-reactivity and
              autoimmunity. Tumor cells can hijack these protective mechanisms
              to enable immune escape, cancer survival and proliferation.
              Blocking antibodies, designed to interfere with checkpoint
              molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 and counteract these immune
              suppressive mechanisms, have shown significant success in
              promoting immune responses against cancer and can result in tumor
              regression in many patients. While inhibitors to CTLA-4 and the
              PD-1/PD-L1 axis are well-established for the clinical management
              of melanoma, many patients do not respond or develop resistance
              to these interventions. Concerted efforts have focused on
              combinations of approved therapies aiming to further augment
              positive outcomes and survival. While CTLA-4 and PD-1 are the
              most-extensively researched targets, results from pre-clinical

              mechanisms controlling such migration have been unclear. As a
              result of careful research, it is now apparent that the process
              is regulated at multiple stages from initial leucocyte entry and
              intraluminal crawling in peripheral tissue lymphatics, through to
              leucocyte exit in draining lymph nodes where the migrating cells

              of tumors, invasion of tumors into healthy tissue, and response
              of tumors to therapies are still poorly understood. Although
              genetic mutations are in general the first step in the
              development of a cancer, for the mutated cell to persist in a
              tissue, it must compete against the other, healthy or diseased
              cells, for example by becoming more motile, adhesive, or
              multiplying faster. Thus, the cellular phenotype determines the
              success of a cancer cell in competition with its neighbors,
              irrespective of the genetic mutations or physiological
              alterations that gave rise to the altered phenotype. What
              phenotypes can make a cell ``successful'' in an environment of
              healthy and cancerous cells, and how? A widely used tool for
              getting more insight into that question is cell-based modeling.
              Cell-based models constitute a class of computational,
              agent-based models that mimic biophysical and molecular
              interactions between cells. One of the most widely used
              cell-based modeling formalisms is the cellular Potts model (CPM),
              a lattice-based, multi particle cell-based modeling approach. The
              CPM has become a popular and accessible method for modeling
              mechanisms of multicellular processes including cell sorting,
              gastrulation, or angiogenesis. The CPM accounts for biophysical
              cellular properties, including cell proliferation, cell motility,
              and cell adhesion, which play a key role in cancer. Multiscale
              models are constructed by extending the agents with intracellular
              processes including metabolism, growth, and signaling. Here we
              review the use of the CPM for modeling tumor growth, tumor
              invasion, and tumor progression. We argue that the accessibility
              and flexibility of the CPM, and its accurate, yet coarse-grained
              and computationally efficient representation of cell and tissue
              biophysics, make the CPM the method of choice for modeling
              cellular processes in tumor development.",

              In this perspective, we advocate for the hypothesis that tumor
              cells with significantly elevated genomic content (polyploid
              tumor cells) facilitate rapid tumor evolution and the acquisition
              of therapy resistance in multiple incurable cancers. We appeal to
              studies conducted in yeast, cancer models, and cancer patients,

              large phenotypic leaps, providing access to many different

              DNA damage/DNA repair in cancer has yet to be appreciably
              explored. In this review, we examine the evidence connecting DNA
              damage and repair mechanisms with cell metabolism through three
              principal links. (1) Regulation of methyl- and acetyl-group
              donors through different metabolic pathways can impact DNA
              folding and remodeling, an essential part of accurate double
              strand break repair. (2) Glutamine, aspartate, and other
              nutrients are essential for de novo nucleotide synthesis, which
              dictates the availability of the nucleotide pool, and thereby
              influences DNA repair and replication. (3) Reactive oxygen
              species, which can increase oxidative DNA damage and hence the
              load of the DNA-repair machinery, are regulated through different
              metabolic pathways. Interestingly, while metabolism affects DNA
              repair, DNA damage can also induce metabolic rewiring. Activation
              of the DNA damage response (DDR) triggers an increase in
              nucleotide synthesis and anabolic glucose metabolism, while also
              reducing glutamine anaplerosis. Furthermore, mutations in genes
              involved in the DDR and DNA repair also lead to metabolic
              rewiring. Links between cancer metabolism and DNA damage/DNA
              repair are increasingly apparent, yielding opportunities to
              investigate the mechanistic basis behind potential metabolic

  abstract = "The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among
              mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the
              largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an
              overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain
              mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more
              glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify
              the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained
              mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies
              using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the
              brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and
              insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules
              apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer
              be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain.
              These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional
              in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many
              neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate
              brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped
              human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a
              fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what
              regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain
              does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains:
              compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as
              well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving
              scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among
              economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence
              containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a
              view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers
              of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call
              for a re-examination of several concepts related to the

              increased research in recent years, control of advanced-stage
              disease and optimal therapeutic responses remain elusive. Recent
              technological improvements have increased our understanding of
              human cancer as a heterogeneous disease. For instance, four
              hallmarks of cancer have recently been included, which in
              addition to being involved in cancer development, could be
              involved in therapeutic responses and resistance. One of these
              hallmarks is chromosome instability (CIN), a source of genetic
              variation in either altered chromosome number or structure. CIN
              has become a hot topic in recent years, not only for its
              implications in cancer diagnostics and prognostics, but also for
              its role in therapeutic responses. Chromosomal alterations are
              mainly used to determine genetic heterogeneity in tumors, but CIN
              could also reveal treatment efficacy, as many therapies are based
              on increasing CIN, which causes aberrant cells to undergo
              apoptosis. However, it should be noted that contradictory
              findings on the implications of CIN for the therapeutic response

              better therapeutic response and others associating it with

              genomic instability, cancer cells typically have elevated
              proteotoxic stress. Recent appreciation of this functional link
              between the two secondary hallmarks of cancer: aneuploidy
              (oxidative stress) and proteotoxic stress, has therefore led to
              the development of new anticancer therapies targeting this
              emerging ``Achilles heel'' of malignancy. This review highlights
              the importance of managing proteotoxic stress for cancer cell
              survival and provides an overview of the integral role
              proteostasis pathways play in the maintenance of protein
              homeostasis. We further review the efforts undertaken to exploit
              proteotoxic stress in multiple myeloma (as an example of a
              hematologic malignancy) and triple negative breast cancer (as an

              CD137 targeted antibody. Model dynamics and best fitting
              parameters were compared, in order to assess the mode of action

              malignancies are genomically and functionally very different

              alterations include aneuploidy (numerical and structural changes

               scale-dependent nature. Determining appropriate mapping scales
               in topographically heterogenous landscapes can be difficult. A
               method is presented for estimating multiscale surface roughness
               based on the standard deviation of surface normals. This method
               utilizes scale partitioning and integral image processing to
               isolate scales of surface complexity. The computational
               efficiency of the method enables high scale sampling density and
               identification of maximum roughness for each grid cell in a
               digital elevation model (DEM). The approach was applied to a 0.5
               m resolution LiDAR DEM of a 210 km2 area near Brantford, Canada.
               The case study demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in
               roughness properties. At shorter scales, tillage patterns and
               other micro-topography associated with ground beneath forest
               cover dominated roughness scale signatures. Extensive
               agricultural land-use resulted in 35.6\% of the site exhibiting
               maximum roughness at micro-topographic scales. At larger spatial

               including incised channels and meander cut banks, were
               associated with maximum surface roughness. This method allowed

              highlighted in the literature, there has been very little

              framework for predicting tumor growth trajectories by coupling:
              (1) the fractal geometric properties of tumor vascular networks,
              (2) metabolic properties of tumor cells and host vascular
              systems, and (3) spatial gradients in resources and metabolic

              use these characteristic exponents to predict metabolic rates for

               psychosocial research to deal with skewed data. This paper
               highlights serious problems in this classic approach for dealing
               with skewed data. Despite the common belief that the log
               transformation can decrease the variability of data and make
               data conform more closely to the normal distribution, this is
               usually not the case. Moreover, the results of standard
               statistical tests performed on log-transformed data are often
               not relevant for the original, non-transformed data.We
               demonstrate these problems by presenting examples that use
               simulated data. We conclude that if used at all, data
               transformations must be applied very cautiously. We recommend
               that in most circumstances researchers abandon these traditional
               methods of dealing with skewed data and, instead, use newer
               analytic methods that are not dependent on the distribution the

              tumors eliminable by the immune system. However, this MHC II
              expression has been associated with poor prognosis, and there is
              a lack of immune-mediated eradication. The lymphocyte activation
              gene-3 (LAG-3) is a natural ligand for MHC II that is
              substantially expressed on melanoma-infiltrating T cells
              including those endowed with potent immune-suppressive activity.
              Based on our previous data showing the signaling capacity of MHC
              II in melanoma cells, we hypothesized that LAG-3 could contribute
              to melanoma survival through its MHC II signaling capacity in
              melanoma cells. In this study, we demonstrate that both soluble
              LAG-3 and LAG-3-transfected cells can protect MHC II-positive
              melanoma cells, but not MHC II-negative cells, from FAS-mediated
              and drug-induced apoptosis. Interaction of LAG-3 with MHC II

              studies using specific inhibitors of both pathways provided
              evidence of their involvement in the LAG-3-induced protection
              from apoptosis. Altogether, our data suggest that the LAG-3-MHC
              II interaction could be viewed as a bidirectional immune escape
              pathway in melanoma, with direct consequences shared by both
              melanoma and immune cells. In the future, compounds that
              efficiently hinder LAG-3-MHC II interaction might be used as an

              melanoma model in which initial regression of advanced disease
              was followed by tumor recurrence. During recurrence, Foxp3(+)

              developing a novel biosensor assay that detects continuous,
              protease-specific activity in target cells. Biosensors were
              engineered from a circularly permuted luciferase, linked
              internally by either caspase 3/7 or granzyme B/caspase 8 cleavage
              sites, thus allowing activation upon proteolytic cleavage by the
              respective proteases. Coincubation of murine CTLs with target
              cells expressing either type of biosensor led to a robust
              luminescent signal within minutes of cell contact. The signal was
              modulated by the strength of TCR signaling, the ratio of

              checkpoints on individual cells within the tumor
              microenvironment. Recent advances in multiple immunolabeling and
              multispectral imaging have enabled simultaneous analysis of more
              than three markers within a single formalin-fixed
              paraffin-embedded tissue section, with accurate cell
              discrimination and spatial information. However, multiplex
              immunohistochemistry with a maximized number of markers presents
              multiple difficulties. These include the primary Ab
              concentrations and order within the multiplex panel, which are of
              major importance for the staining result. In this article, we
              report on the development, optimization, and application of an
              eight-color multiplex immunohistochemistry panel, consisting of
              PD-1, PD-L1, OX40, CD27, TIM3, CD3, a tumor marker, and DAPI.
              This multiplex panel allows for simultaneous quantification of
              five different immune checkpoint molecules on individual cells
              within different tumor types. This analysis revealed major
              differences in the immune checkpoint expression patterns across
              tumor types and individual tumor samples. This method could
              ultimately, by characterizing the tumor microenvironment of
              patients who have been treated with different immune checkpoint
              modulators, form the rationale for the design of immune
              checkpoint-based immunotherapy in the future.",

              cancer patients, and is associated with early tumor recurrence,
              lymph node metastasis and tamoxifen-resistance. We developed a
              novel co-culture system to understand the mechanism(s) by which a
              loss of stromal fibroblast Cav-1 induces a ``lethal tumor
              micro-environment.'' Here, we propose a new paradigm to explain
              the powerful prognostic value of stromal Cav-1. In this model,
              cancer cells induce oxidative stress in cancer-associated
              fibroblasts, which then acts as a ``metabolic'' and ``mutagenic''
              motor to drive tumor-stroma co-evolution, DNA damage and
              aneuploidy in cancer cells. More specifically, we show that an
              acute loss of Cav-1 expression leads to mitochondrial
              dysfunction, oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in cancer
              associated fibroblasts. Also, we propose that defective
              mitochondria are removed from cancer-associated fibroblasts by
              autophagy/mitophagy that is induced by oxidative stress. As a
              consequence, cancer associated fibroblasts provide nutrients
              (such as lactate) to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and
              oxidative metabolism in adjacent cancer cells (the ``Reverse
              Warburg Effect''). We provide evidence that oxidative stress in
              cancer-associated fibroblasts is sufficient to induce genomic
              instability in adjacent cancer cells, via a bystander effect,
              potentially increasing their aggressive behavior. Finally, we
              directly demonstrate that nitric oxide (NO) over-production,
              secondary to Cav-1 loss, is the root cause for mitochondrial
              dysfunction in cancer associated fibroblasts. In support of this
              notion, treatment with anti-oxidants (such as N-acetyl-cysteine,
              metformin and quercetin) or NO inhibitors (L-NAME) was sufficient
              to reverse many of the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotypes
              that we describe. Thus, cancer cells use ``oxidative stress'' in
              adjacent fibroblasts (i) as an ``engine'' to fuel their own
              survival via the stromal production of nutrients and (ii) to
              drive their own mutagenic evolution towards a more aggressive
              phenotype, by promoting genomic instability. We also present
              evidence that the ``field effect'' in cancer biology could also
              be related to the stromal production of ROS and NO species.
              eNOS-expressing fibroblasts have the ability to downregulate
              Cav-1 and induce mitochondrial dysfunction in adjacent
              fibroblasts that do not express eNOS. As such, the effects of
              stromal oxidative stress can be laterally propagated, amplified
              and are effectively ``contagious''--spread from cell-to-cell like
              a virus--creating an ``oncogenic/mutagenic'' field promoting
              widespread DNA damage.",

              B16F10 melanoma invasion into the dermis with up to 600 µm
              penetration depth and reconstruct both invasion mode and tissue
              tracks to establish invasion routes and outcome. B16F10 cells

              tracks of complex, multi-interface topography, combining
              single-cell and collective migration modes, without immediate
              anatomic tissue remodeling or destruction. The data suggest that
              the dimensionality (1D, 2D, 3D) of tissue interfaces determines
              the microanatomy exploited by invading tumor cells, emphasizing
              non-destructive migration along microchannels coupled to contact

              Theory shows that cell growth is maximized when all expressed

              present a pilot study in which abiraterone dosing is guided by
              evolution-informed mathematical models to delay onset of
              resistance. METHODS: In the study cohort, abiraterone was stopped
              when PSA was 50\% PSA decline after initial abiraterone
              administration and met trial eligibility requirements but chose
              standard of care (SOC) dosing. RESULTS: 17 subjects were enrolled
              in the adaptive therapy group and 16 in the SOC group. All SOC
              subjects have progressed, but four patients in the study cohort
              remain stably cycling (range 53-70 months). The study cohort had
              significantly improved median time to progression (TTP; 33.5
              months; p<0.001) and median overall survival (OS; 58.5 months;
              hazard ratio, 0.41, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.83,
              p<0.001) compared to 14.3 and 31.3 months in the SOC cohort. On
              average, study subjects received no abiraterone during 46\% of
              time on trial. Longitudinal trial data demonstrated the
              competition coefficient ratio ($\alpha$RS/$\alpha$SR) of
              sensitive and resistant populations, a critical factor in
              intratumoral evolution, was two- to threefold higher than
              pre-trial estimates. Computer simulations of intratumoral
              evolutionary dynamics in the four long-term survivors found that,
              due to the larger value for $\alpha$RS/$\alpha$SR, cycled therapy
              significantly decreased the resistant population. Simulations in
              subjects who progressed predicted further increases in OS could
              be achieved with prompt abiraterone withdrawal after achieving
              50\% PSA reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporation of evolution-based
              mathematical models into abiraterone monotherapy for mCRPC
              significantly increases TTP and OS. Computer simulations with
              updated parameters from longitudinal trial data can estimate

              tissues but is frequently deficient in a variety of cancers. It
              has been suggested that this metabolic difference between normal
              and cancer cells may be exploited to selectively treat
              MTAP-negative cancers by inhibiting de novo purine synthesis and
              by depleting L-methionine. However, these therapeutic strategies
              have only been tested in naturally occurring MTAP-positive and
              -negative cell lines, which might have additional genetic
              alterations that affect chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Therefore,
              it is of importance to examine the feasibility of
              enzyme-selective treatment using paired cell lines that have an
              identical genotype except for MTAP status. MTAP-negative A549
              lung cancer cells were transfected with eukaryotic expression
              vectors encoding MTAP cDNA in sense and antisense orientations.
              The resultant stable transfectomas were treated with inhibitors
              of de novo purine synthesis such as methotrexate,
              5,10-dideazatetrahydrofolate, and L-alanosine and by methionine
              depletion. The A549 cells transfected with an antisense construct
              (antisense transfectoma) expressed no MTAP protein and were more
              sensitive to both purine and methionine depletion than were cells
              expressing MTAP protein (sense transfectoma). Methylthioadenosine
              was able to completely rescue the sense transfectoma but not the
              antisense transfectoma from growth inhibition by depletion of
              purine and methionine. These results prove that MTAP deficiency
              contributes directly to the sensitivity of cancer cells to purine
              or methionine depletion. Inhibition of de novo purine synthesis,
              combined with methionine depletion in the presence of
              methylthioadenosine, is a highly selective treatment for
              MTAP-negative cancers.",

              non-specific inflammatory response progresses to a host
              T-cell-mediated tumor-specific response. In cross-over
              experiments using MCA-105 and MCA-205 sarcoma tumors, pulmonary
              metastatic disease was eradicated only in mice treated with
              tumor-matched TIL + rIL-2. In vitro, TIL stimulated with the

              granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)
              compared to TIL stimulated with mismatched tumor cells. In lungs
              of tumor-bearing mice treated with matched TIL + rIL-2,

              tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) positive cells were

              depletion of dendritic cells and macrophages abrogated more than
              80\% of the efficacy. Our data suggest that successful IT may
              require 3 steps: (1) release of inflammatory cytokines by donor
              TIL after restimulation by tumor cells; (2) infiltration of host
              immune cells in response to local cytokine production; and (3)

              which drives cells from the G1 to S phase of cell cycles. In the

              serum starvation-induced cell cycle arrest in human ovarian
              cancer cells, SK-OV-3. Cell cycle analysis showed that cells were
              arrested at the G1 phase after serum starvation. Western blot
              analysis showed that the protein levels of CDK4 and CDK2 were

               principally the reduction of the sample information to estimates
               and their marginal distribution and supposedly optimal
               properties. In contrast, this book emphasizes techniques for
               dividing the sample information into various parts addressing
               the diverse problems of inference that arise from repeatable
               experiments. An unusually valuable feature of the book is the
               large number of practical examples, many of which use data taken

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND AIM: The clinical efficiency of cisplatin (CDDP)
              against gastric cancer is often limited by the development of
              resistance. A third-generation platinum-containing agent,
              oxaliplatin (L-OHP), has been introduced for treating gastric
              cancer. Here, we studied oxaliplatin in vitro to reveal the
              mechanism of acquiring drug resistance and whether a
              cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cell line has susceptibility
              to oxaliplatin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cisplatin-resistant
              gastric cancer cell line (MKN45/CDDP/ R1) was established by
              continuous exposure of MKN45 cells to cisplatin. The amount of
              excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) and
              glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-pi mRNA was measured by real-time
              polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To examine the chemosensitivity
              to CDDP and L-OHP in MKN45 and MKN45/CDDP/R1 cells, a collagen
              gel droplet-embedded culture drug sensitivity test (CD-DST) was
              performed. The intracellular concentration of CDDP and L-OHP were
              also measured to see if the drugs would be taken up by these cell
              lines. RESULTS: The MKN45/CDDP/R1 cell line was resistant to
              CDDP. The ERCC1 and GST-pi mRNA was significantly increased in
              MKN45/CDDP/R1 cells, indicating that the cells acquired
              resistance to CDDP. Intracellular CDDP was not detected in
              MKN45/CDDP/R1 cells up to 48 h after incubation, indicating that
              uptake and efflux processes of CDDP were altered in these cells.
              MKN45/CDDP/R1 cells were still susceptible to L-OHP. The
              intracellular concentration of CDDP but not L-OHP was
              significantly reduced in MKN45/CDDP/R1 cells. CONCLUSION: We
              established a CDDP-resistant cell line using MKN45 cells, in
              which ERCC1 and GST-pi were increased. This cell line showed
              susceptibility to the new generation platinum agent L-OHP,

               combinatorics, statistical physics, and theoretical computer
               science. Many of the techniques presented originate in these
               disciplines. The central tools for estimating convergence times,
               including coupling, strong stationary times, and spectral
               methods, are developed. The authors discuss many examples,

               electrical networks and apply it to estimate hitting and cover

              continuously in the body. Many sources of stress heat,
              irradiation, hyperoxia, inflammation and any increases in
              metabolism including exercise, injury, and even repair processes
              lead to increased production of free radicals and associated
              reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Evidence is
              accumulating that free radicals have important functions in the
              signal network of cells, including induction of growth and
              apoptosis and as killing tools of immunocompetent cells.
              Endogenous and nutritional antioxidant systems have to be
              adjusted to ensure adequate removal of radicals during stress to
              prevent damage to membranes, proteins, or nucleic acids.
              Excessive stress will induce DNA damage in the form of oxidized
              nucleosides, strand breaks, or DNA-protein crosslinks. Possible
              consequences of DNA damage are repair, apoptosis/necrosis, or
              defective repair leading to DNA sequence alterations and possibly
              to the development of cancer or, in case of mitochondrial DNA, to
              metabolic dysfunction. Excessive exercise will also induce DNA
              damage in peripheral leukocytes. The good message is that
              moderate stress in form of regular exercise/training may have
              protective effects against exercise-induced DNA damage.
              Up-regulation of endogenous antioxidant defense systems and

              beneficially influence our health. Massive intervention into the

              should be regarded with caution due to the ambiguous role of free

              during animal development [2], but it is not known how they
              divide this task. Using time-lapse recordings of cells in
              culture, we show that professional phagocytes (brain macrophages
              or microglia) are highly motile, ingest apoptotic cells
              immediately, and digest them quickly. Non-professionals such as
              BHK and lens epithelial cells are sessile, often recognize
              apoptotic cells as soon as they die by showing characteristic
              palpating movements, but delay ingestion until several hours
              later. By pre-ageing apoptotic cells, we show that this delay is
              because the apoptotic cells must undergo further changes before
              non-professionals can ingest them. The difference was also
              apparent in vivo, using immunofluorescence and electron
              microscopy of the developing central nervous system. This

              synthesis, than are MTAP+ primary T-ALL cells. As measured by
              [3H]thymidine incorporation, DNA synthesis in all seven
              MTAP-primary T-ALL cells was inhibited by L-alanosine with a mean
              IC50 of 4.8+/-5.3 ILM (range, 0.3-11.3 microM). On the other
              hand, the IC50 for 60\% (12 of 20) of MTAP+ primary T-ALL was
              19+/-18 microM (range, 1.7-67 microM; P = 0.02), whereas the

              be protected from L.-alanosine toxicity, whereas MTAP-tumor cells
              would be killed. Thus, our results support the use of L-alanosine

              therapy and therefore lay the foundation for the initiation of

              influence Fas-mediated cell death in prostate cancer cells. In
              vitro exposure of the human cell lines LNCaP and PC3 and the
              mouse cell line RM-1 to agonist anti-Fas antibody and/or soluble
              Fas ligand resulted in killing of only PC3 cells. However,
              preincubation with IFN-gamma resulted in synergistic killing in
              all three cell lines. In vitro treatment of RM-1 with a
              replication-incompetent adenovirus expressing mouse FasL
              (Ad.FasL) resulted in maximal cell kill near 40\%, which
              correlated with baseline Fas expression. The addition of
              IFN-gamma enhanced cell kill to a degree consistent with the
              resulting higher levels of Fas and maintained synergistic killing
              at very low doses of vector. Co-inoculation of orthotopic RM-1
              primary tumors with Ad.mFasL and an adenovirus expressing mouse
              IL-12 (Ad.mIL-12) to drive host production of IFN-gamma negated
              the survival advantage of Ad.mIL-12 alone. However, the staggered

              higher levels of apoptosis in primary tumor tissue and doubled

              increased sensitivity to Fas-mediated cell death in prostate

              decreased responses to polyclonal activators and to alloantigens.
              Because 4-1BB expression is induced following primary
              stimulation, we investigated the role of signaling through this
              molecule in the reactivation of proliferating T cells. To this
              end, preactivated, 4-1BB-expressing T cells were restimulated in
              the presence of plate-immobilized mAbs directed against 4-1BB or
              the prototypic costimulatory molecule CD28. In this work, we show
              that in the presence of either signal, T cells respond to TCR
              cross-linking with strong proliferative responses and cytokine
              production; moreover, our findings indicate that T cell
              proliferation partially correlates with surface 4-1BB expression.
              In addition, our results suggest that Ab-mediated costimulatory
              signals can act independently of potential accessory
              B7-CD28/CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte Ag-4) interactions.
              Importantly, the characteristic DNA fragmentation and apoptotic
              cell death observed after TCR re-engagement are inhibited

               was shown that the experimental data are compatible with a
               simple rate equation, which allows the definition of three
               constants: p, representing the maximal killing rate of the
               effector cell suspension (at target $\rightarrow$$\infty$); q,

  title    = "Migration of individual microvessel endothelial cells: stochastic
              model and parameter measurement",
  author   = "Stokes, C L and Lauffenburger, D A and Williams, S K",
  abstract = "Analysis of cell motility effects in physiological processes can
              be facilitated by a mathematical model capable of simulating
              individual cell movement paths. A quantitative description of
              motility of individual cells would be useful, for example, in the
              study of the formation of new blood vessel networks in
              angiogenesis by microvessel endothelial cell (MEC) migration. In
              this paper we propose a stochastic mathematical model for the
              random motility and chemotaxis of single cells, and evaluate
              migration paths of MEC in terms of this model. In our model, cell
              velocity under random motility conditions is described as a
              persistent random walk using the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U)
              process. Two parameters quantify this process: the magnitude of
              random movement accelerations, alpha, and a decay rate constant
              for movement velocity, beta. Two other quantities often used in
              measurements of individual cell random motility properties--cell
              speed, S, and persistence time in velocity, Pv--can be defined in
              terms of the fundamental stochastic parameters alpha and beta by:
              S =square root (alpha/beta) and Pv = 1/beta. We account for
              chemotactic cell movement in chemoattractant gradients by adding
              a directional bias term to the O-U process. The magnitude of the
              directional bias is characterized by the chemotactic
              responsiveness, kappa. A critical advantage of the proposed model
              is that it can generate, using experimentally measured values of
              alpha, beta and kappa, computer simulations of theoretical
              individual cell paths for use in evaluating the role of cell
              migration in specific physiological processes. We have used the
              model to assess MEC migration in the presence of absence of the
              angiogenic stimulus acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF).
              Time-lapse video was used to observe and track the paths of cells
              moving in various media, and the mean square displacement was
              measured from these paths. To test the validity of the model, we
              compared the mean square displacement measurements of each cell
              with model predictions of that displacement. The comparison
              indicates that the O-U process provides a satisfactory
              description of the random migration at this level of comparison.
              Using nonlinear regression in these comparisons, we measured the
              magnitude of random accelerations, alpha, and the velocity decay
              rate constant, beta, for each cell path. We consequently obtained
              values for the derived quantities, speed and persistence time. In
              control medium, we find that alpha = 250 +/- 100 microns 2h-3 and
              beta = 0.22 +/- 0.03h-1, while in stimulus medium (control plus
              unpurified aFGF) alpha = 1900 +/- 720 microns 2h-3 and beta =
              0.99 +/- 0.37h-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

  abstract  = "CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are critical for eliminating
               virally infected cells. Upon target recognition, CTLs reorganize
               their actin cytoskeleton to facilitate the polarized secretion
               of specialized granules containing lytic proteins that kill
               cells. Because a single CTL can kill multiple targets, granule
               secretion must be tightly regulated, ensuring only appropriate
               cells are killed, and preserving granules for serial killing.
               However, how CTLs regulate secretion remains unclear. Here, we
               used live confocal and TIRF microscopy to evaluate how cortical
               actin affects granule secretion at the membrane. While previous
               work has shown that clearance of actin at the synapse precedes
               granule secretion, we find that after granule fusion, cortical
               actin recovers and no further secretion is observed.
               Depolymerization of recovered actin led to resumed granule
               fusion, suggesting that recovered actin acts as a barrier to
               prevent further lytic granule secretion. We further show that
               CTLs from mice unable to secrete granules due to a Rab27a
               mutation that prevents granule fusion, failed to recover
               cortical actin at the synapse. This suggests that granule fusion
               itself triggers actin recovery in CTLs. Thus, cortical actin
               both regulates, and is regulated by, secretion. Finally, using
               fluorescent reporters, we correlated the clearance and recovery
               of actin with PIP2. PIP2 binds numerous actin regulatory
               proteins, suggesting phosphatidylinositol distribution in the
               membrane as a potential mechanism through which CTLs regulate
               the density of cortical actin during killing. Our work provides
               insight into actin-related mechanisms regulating CTL secretion
               that may serial killing capacity during immune responses.",

  abstract = "Granzyme B (GraB) induces apoptosis in the presence of perforin.
              Perforin polymerizes in the cell membrane to form a nonspecific
              ion pore, but it is not known where GraB acts to initiate the
              events that ultimately lead to apoptosis. It has been
              hypothesized that GraB enters the target cell through a perforin
              channel and then initiates apoptosis by cleaving and activating
              members of the ICE/Ced-3 family of cell death proteases. To
              determine if GraB can enter the cell, we treated YAC-1 or HeLa
              cells with FITC-labeled GraB and measured intracellular
              fluorescence with a high sensitivity CCD camera and image
              analyzer. GraB was internalized and found diffusely dispersed in
              the cell cytoplasm within 10 min. Uptake was inhibited at low
              temperature (4 degrees C) and by pretreatment with metabolic
              inhibitors, NaF and DNP, or cytochalasin B, a drug that both
              blocks microfilament formation, and FITC-GraB remained on the
              cell membrane localized in patches. With the simultaneous
              addition of perforin and FITC-GraB, no significant increase in
              cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed over that found in cells
              treated only with FITC-GraB. However, FITC-GraB was now detected
              in the nucleus of apoptotic cells labeling apoptotic bodies and
              localized areas within and along the nuclear membrane. The
              ability of GraB to enter cells in the absence of perforin was
              reexamined using anti-GraB antibody immunogold staining of
              ultrathin cryosections of cells incubated with GraB. Within 15
              min, gold particles were detected both on the plasma membrane and
              in the cytoplasm of cells with some gold staining adjacent to the
              nuclear envelope but not in the nucleus. Cells internalizing GraB
              in the absence of perforin appeared morphologically normal by
              Hoechst staining and electron microscopy. GraB directly
              microinjected into the cytoplasm of B16 melanoma cells induced
              transient plasma membrane blebbing and nuclear coarsening but the
              cells did not become frankly apoptotic unless perforin was added.
              We conclude that GraB can enter cells autonomously but that
              perforin initiates the apoptotic process and the entry of GraB
              into the nucleus.",

              (SARS-CoV-2) has posed great threat to human health. T cells play
              a critical role in antiviral immunity but their numbers and
              functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear.
              Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the counts of T cells and
              serum cytokine concentration from data of 522 patients with
              laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and 40 healthy controls. In
              addition, the expression of T cell exhaustion markers were
              measured in 14 COVID-19 cases. Results: The number of total T
              cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were dramatically reduced in
              COVID-19 patients, especially in patients requiring Intensive
              Care Unit (ICU) care. Counts of total T cells, CD8+ T cells or
              CD4+ T cells lower than 800, 300, or 400/$\mu$L, respectively,
              were negatively correlated with patient survival. T cell numbers
              were negatively correlated to serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-$\alpha$
              concentration, with patients in the disease resolution period
              showing reduced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-$\alpha$ concentrations and
              restored T cell counts. T cells from COVID-19 patients had
              significantly higher levels of the exhausted marker PD-1.
              Increasing PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on T cells was seen as
              patients progressed from prodromal to overtly symptomatic stages.
              Conclusions: T cell counts are reduced significantly in COVID-19
              patients, and the surviving T cells appear functionally
              exhausted. Non-ICU patients with total T cells counts lower than
              800/$\mu$L may still require urgent intervention, even in the
              immediate absence of more severe symptoms due to a high risk for
              further deterioration in condition.",
