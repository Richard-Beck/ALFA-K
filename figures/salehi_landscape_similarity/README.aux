Each column in the image represents a CNAP. Karyotypes are clustered based on the manhattan distance between their copy number profiles. B) (\(\Delta f\)) comparison between in vitro (cultured) and PDX karyotypes. C) (\(\Delta f\)) comparison between treated and untreated PDX karyotypes. D) Correlation between CNAPs within the same landscape. Each point represents the pearson correlation coefficient between two CNAPs, presented according to the manhattan distance between the two karyotypes in karyotype space. E) Correlation between CNAPs across cell lines. F) correlation of CNAPS across independent lineages of SA609. Untreated lineages are da and bb, cisplatin treated lineage is aaa. G) correlation of CNAPS across independent lineages of SA609. H) Angle metrics indicate similarity of evolutionary paths taken by SA609 lineages. I) Angle metrics indicate similarity of evolutionary paths taken by SA535 lineages.}}{2}{figure.caption.1}\protected@file@percent }
