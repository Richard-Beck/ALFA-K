# ALFA-K

The ABM requires compilation before use. E.g. to compile with the GCC C++ compiler, change to ALFA-K root directory and run:

g++ ./ABM/main.cpp -o ./ABM/bin/ABM

Example_1 demonstrates:
1) setting up and running ABM with randomly generated fitness landscape
2) estimating a fitness landscape using ABM output
3) running ABM with estimated fitness landscape.
